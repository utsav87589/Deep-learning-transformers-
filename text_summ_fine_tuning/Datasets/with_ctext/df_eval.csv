3001,Defence Ministry scraps ?6500 crore Navy chopper deal,"The Defence Ministry has scrapped a Rs 6,500 crore deal for buying 16 multirole helicopters for the Navy from America as the government is bargaining hard on price with foreign vendors and promoting Make in India in the military sector for reducing imports.The decision has come a couple of weeks before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US where he would be meeting American President Donald Trump.With budgets not increasing in proportion with modernization demands of the armed forces, the Defence Ministry is using hard bargaining as a tool to cut down the cost of projects.""The deal for procuring 16 helicopters for the Navy has been scrapped by the Defence Ministry, after it was stuck for over two years on the issues of price, and the American firm Sikorsky refuced to extend the validity of its commercial bid,"" Government sources told Mail today here.The final decision on the matter was taken by the ministry after the Contracts Negotiation Committee (CNC) headed by the Joint Secretary and Acquisition Manager (Maritime Systems) recommended the retraction of the tender.DEAL STUCK OVER PRICEThe deal had been in the making since 2009 when the navy initiated the process for buying 16 multirole choppers for being deployed on its warships.It was stuck over the issue of price for over last two years at the contract negotiation stage but the US firm did not agree to extend the validity of its commercial offer. It is now learnt that the procurement of these 16 choppers would be merged with a Make in India programme to produce around 140 Naval Multirole Helicopters (NMRH) for equipping all major naval warships with one multirole helicopter each when they go in for blue water missions and anti-piracy patrols.On the need for keeping the deal alive, Defence Ministry sources said, that the American firm would extend the validity of its price bid and also reduce the price of the choppers which was higher than the benchmark set by the government.UPGRADING ANTI-SUBMARINE CAPABILITIESThe 16 multirole helicopters are sought by the Navy for upgrading its anti-submarine warfare capabilities, which are on a decline as the Seaking helicopters bought from the UK in 1980s, would be on their way out from the force in near future, they added.Sikorsky was selected by the Navy for its requirements in December 2014 as it emerged as the only bidder in the race after Finmeccannica was chucked out of competition due to the chopper scam allegations on it.After the tender bid was opened, sources said there was a demand made to raise the price of the choppers to meet inflation, but the defence ministry sought a further cut in the price demanded by the firm originally in its commercial bid.Other issues like liability clause were also responsible for holding up the deal for some time, sources said.Navy sources said the deal is required badly for the force as it has to find a replacement for the SeaKing - 42 choppers bought from British firm Westland helicopters."

3004,Man throws his pet puppy from balcony for dropping laptop,"A man tossed his pet puppy off his first-floor balcony in Gurgaon's Sector 42 in an act of revenge after she dropped his laptop while playing with it and chewed up the DTH wires on Tuesday night.After a neighbour, who himself owns a German shepherd, heard the cries of the pup in the bushes and confronted the offender, he allegedly scooted.    The four-month-old puppy suffered a fracture on her right foreleg. She was brought by the owner's wife and their neighbour to the CGS Pet Hospital in Gurugram. The canine will undergo surgery to heal the broken bone soon.Experts said this is not an isolated incident and cases of insensitivity against animals are on the rise. In July last year, two medical students - Gautam Sudarshan and Ashish Paul - flung a stray from their private college terrace in Chennai while holding her just by the ear and skin.Similarly, a psychopath, Nakul Mishra, was found stabbing dogs to death at the Green Park Metro Station in Delhi, and an unemployed Dwarka resident chopped off the hind legs of a puppy with a hacksaw when it scratched him in December 2016.PUP'S OWNER FLEESArvind Kumar, an IT professional and resident of HUDA, M-Block, sector 42 in Gurugram, who saw the incident happening on Tuesday, said, ""It was around 11 pm. I was doing my laundry in the backyard when I heard a sharp cry from a dog. When I came down to check, I saw the fearful puppy limping and hiding in the bushes.The couple, Dora Shlem and Phillip Maxwell, reached the spot too, and when I enquired from Maxwell, he denied doing anything but immediately fled in his car. His wife Dora told me everything.""Dora has given a written confession and also told Mail Today, ""Generally, we love her, but that day, it really damaged the whole laptop, chewed up wires and everything. My husband got angry and flung it.""Arvind said he will file an FIR against Maxwell.   Abhinav Srihan, founder of the NGO Fauna Police, said, ""It is extremely sad that people do such things to helpless animals. Puppies are just like human babies. They will be naughty and damage a shoe, furniture or TV once in a while. If you cannot tolerate their smell, hair or such acts, please do not adopt them.""  LAX LAWS Activists say the laws against such crimes are very lax and their implementation is even more pathetic. Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 has provision for a maximum fine of Rs 50 and punishment of three months only.Also, Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code, which regards killing and maiming of an animal, gives a maximum punishment of five years that has so far not been given to anyone.Amita Singh, an animal rights activist and JNU professor, said, ""Our whole struggle comes to a naught when these people simply get a bail and escape with a fine of just Rs 50."""
3005,AAP fined ?27L for 'unauthorised occupation' of Delhi office,"The Aam Aadmi Party has landed in a fresh controversy related to its party office. The Delhi government's PWD department has served a notice on the political group to pay Rs 27 lakh as fine for having failed to vacate its Rouse Avenue office within the stipulated time.Mail Today is in possession of a copy of the notice served to the Aam Aadmi Party.The notice was served on Tuesday in reply to the party's plea in which party requested to continue its operations from the 206, Rouse Avenue address. It was addressed to the Aam Aadmi Party's national secretary Pankaj Kumar Gupta.The letter written by deputy secretary, Debasis Biswal mentions that there is no provision under the rules to extend the ""illegal occupation"". Hence, the party is liable to pay a penal rent for the period of unauthorised occupation, says the notice.RS 27 LAKH FINE The amount which has been calculated by the department up to May 31 amounts to Rs 27,73,802, says the letter. The letter further says that the dues will further accrue up to the date the premises are finally vacated.In another notice, the government also turned down the proposal of party in which it asked for an alternative accommodation before vacating the Rouse Avenue office.Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, in early April, had cancelled the allotment of 206, Rouse Avenue premises as the party office of AAP. The bungalow was allocated through a state cabinet decision of the Aam Aadmi Party last year.In an earlier communication to the government, L-G Anil Baijal had communicated to the government that he was within his right to cancel the allocation of the office as it had been usurped by violating the rules.In a note written to the Government which has challenged LG order Baijal has written that it is a clear case of conflict of interest as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also the convenor of Aam Aadmi Party and hence action can be taken on that front as well."
3006,"Detection of fake currency has risen 4,000% in 8 years","By Neelabh Srivastava New Delhi, Jun 14 (PTI) Counterfeit currency detection instances in the countrys banking channels have seen an all time increase in the last eight years at over 3.53 lakh instances, according to a latest government report. All banks, either public sector, private and foreign banks in the country, are mandated to report such instances to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under anti-money laundering law provisions. ""The number of counterfeit currency reports (CCRs) increased from a mere 8,580 in 2007-08 to 35,730 in 2008-09 and 3,53,837 in 2014-15,"" the report, accessed by PTI, said. However, the amount of fake currency detected has not been specified. CCR is defined as the usage of a forged or counterfeit currency note or bank note as genuine or where any forgery of a valuable security or a document has taken place during a cash transaction at a bank. As per the data complied since 2007-08, when the government first mandated the FIU to receive such reports under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) from banks, the year 2009-10 saw reportage of 1,27,781 CCR, in 2010-11 it was 2,51,448, in 2011-12 it was 3,27,382, in 2012-13 they were 3,62,371 and in 2013-14 a total of 3,01,804 such instances were reported. The data for 2010-11 to 2014-15 shows that the major chunk of these reports, at over 90 per cent, were filed by private Indian banks and a majority of them pertain to usage of fake Indian currency notes (FICN) and not any other valuable security as defined under the CCR terminology. ""The private Indian banks contribute majority of CCRs. The compliance levels of the public sector banks continued to be low despite the matter having been taken up with the RBI,"" the report said. It added that during the ""review"" of public sector banks on this issue, the best practices of private Indian banks in detection and reporting of counterfeit currency notes were highlighted. A senior Finance Ministry official put the figures in perspective: ""CCRs are meant to check the menace and extent of FICN entering the banking system which forms a very important part of the functioning of the economy. ""While the figures of the eight years, since the regime of reportage of such incidents first began, have shown an increasing trend, it is good that the banks are increasingly able to detect them and report to the FIU,"" the official said. The FIU under the Union finance ministry, acts as the national agency to provide financial intelligence to law enforcement agencies for safeguarding the economy from abuses of money laundering, terrorist financing and other offences, further disseminates this data to investigative agencies to ascertain the source of the FICN and undertake legal action under criminal laws aimed to check money laundering and black money. The report, however, did not talk about the results after the CCRs were handed over to probe agencies like the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and others.  The report said the FIU, during 2014-15 also received a total of 58,646 suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from all types of banks, financial institutions like insurance companies, intermediaries like stock brokers and additional non-financial businesses and professions like casinos and private locker operators. The STRs in the latest data compiled year of 2014-15 were the second highest after 61,953 such reports were received by the FIU in 2013-14. A suspicious transaction, under PMLA, is defined as any transaction that either indicates that it has been made in circumstances of unusual or unjustified complexity or appears to have no economic rationale or bonafide purpose. The definition is also applicable to those transactions that give rise to a reasonable ground of suspicion that it may involve financing of the activities relating to terrorism. As per data, the maximum STRs are reported to the FIU by banks as compared to any other financial intermediary mandated to do so in the country. Acting on these STRs, the report said, ""the CBDT (Income Tax Department) detected unaccounted income of Rs 4,471.65 crore while it seized assets worth Rs 65 crore, the Customs and Service Tax department detected tax evasion to the tune of Rs 21.59 crore and the Enforcement Directorate detected and seized proceeds of crime to the tune of Rs 25 crore during 2014-15."" The agency also received over 3.4 lakh cross-border wire transfer reports (CBWTR) during the said time period. "
3007,Sleep with me if you want your husband freed: Cop to woman,"The Jodhpur police arrested a man with 1kg opium last week. The man's wife has been running pillar to post to get her husband out of the jail. She was offered help by a cop but he wanted a deal.Sitting behind bars, Rajiv Gandhi police station incharge Kamaldan Charan must be cursing himself for his depraved behavior. The cop was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) for taking money from a woman whose husband was held in connection with drug trafficking. Kamaldan Charan had far more sinister plans other than just making some quick money. INDECENT PROPOSALCharan arrested a man in possession of 1kg opium last week. The wife of the accused approached the cop asking him for help to get her husband out of jail.The pervert cop agreed to help her but for that she would have to agree for a deal. The woman was shocked to hear what Charan wanted in return of release of her husband.Apart from Rs 2 lakh, the policeman wanted the woman to sleep with him. The woman somehow managed Rs 1 lakh and gave it to Kamaldan Charan. She also gave him a cheque of Rs 1 lakh as guarantee. But the Charan insisted on cash. When the woman expressed her inability in providing him with the money, the 'predator' cop asked her to 'compromise' if she wanted her man to be free.Charan told the woman that he will come at her house in night to 'enjoy' and spend some time with her. Stunned by what she heard, the woman immediately approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). After verifying the facts, ACB sleuths laid a trap to nab Kamaldan Charan red handed. HOW THE PERVERT COP WAS ARRESTEDCharan told the woman he would visit her on Tuesday night when is out on patrolling duty. The ACB was informed about this. He reached the woman's house on time and bolted the doors from inside. Before he could proceed according to his plan, the door bell rang. Charan's game was over. The ACB arrested him red handed with the Rs 1 lakh cheque that the woman had given him. ALSO READ:Bhopal: Cops beat 80-year-old woman with sticks, break her bones for 'ordering ruckus'"

3009,Muslims protest plan to make marriage registration mandatory,"As the Uttar Pradesh government is planning to make marriage registration mandatory, Muslims are getting ready to come out on the roads in protest of this 'un-Islamic' move.Talking to India Today on this issue, Muslim leader Haji Jameeluddin said the Muslim community cannot accept the UP government's edict to register Muslim marriages at the marriage registrar's office as Muslim marriages are only registered at the office of the Waqf board of UP as per the Nikahnama documents.He said Muslim marriages are already registered according to the Sharia law and there was no need to register them again merely to satisfy a government's whim.He said the attention of both the Centre and the state governments have shifted from development and crime control to such frivolous issues. This is merely to divert the attention of the people from the issues raging before the country, which the Muslims will not tolerate.Bhartiya Muslim Vikas Parishad chairman Sami Aghai said that the Yogi government seeks to keep the Hindus and Muslims of UP tied up in such petty issues so that they never raise their demand for development. He said that similar issue came up during the Samajwadi Party government as well but the Muslims did not let it gain prominence with their protests and the Akhilesh Yadav government had to shelve this topic.Former president of the Muslim wing of Samajwadi Party Md Yaseen Qureshi said  Muslim marriages get registered at the time they are solemnised so Muslims do not need an additional registration, whereas most Hindu marriages are conducted without any paperwork.Mufti Mudassar Ali Qadri said that Muslim marriages are conducted according to Sharia, which is why the Muslim personal law has been defined separately in the Indian Constitution. The Qazi who conducts these marriages is registered with the state government and he has to present the statistics of marriages conducted by him in a year to the state government, he said.However, BJP leader Ashfaq Saifi claimed that since the order had not been given by the state government, but it was given by the Supreme Court, the Muslims as well as the state government, were duty bound to honour the Court's will. He said that some Muslim leaders are unnecessarily dragging the name of Yogi Adityanath in this matter, whereas the Chief Minister has issued an order to make all the marriages mandatory, irrespective of the religion. The rules are still being prepared by the women welfare department of the state government and as soon as the rules are ready, they will be brought into effect.Saifi said that whoever declines to obey these rules, shall be barred from availing government benefits, while those who register their marriages after a delay, shall be liable for a fine.Clearing confusion on this issue, senior advocate Md Arif said if a Muslim deposits his Nikahnama at the registrar's office, it will be deemed as a marriage registration and even if that copy is deposited by the Qazi who conducted the Nikah, the registration will be deemed effective."

3011,Sinha advocates 'pitamah' Advani's name for next president,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may have formed a three-member team to pick a candidate to represent the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the upcoming presidential election but party leader Shatrughan Sinha believes there's no one better than LK Advani to represent the ruling alliance.In a series of tweets, Shatrughan Sinha called Advani 'pitamah' (father figure) said the veteran leader should have the first and last choice as presidential candidate. ""Advaniji is far above others if election is done through a referendum or direct voting by the people, of the people & for the people. Advani ji should have been the 1st & last choice of the country for the President's post in present scenario,"" the actor-turned politician said.""I sincerely hope, wish and pray that good sense prevails on one and all and the Pitamah of BJP is bestowed upon with the honour that he most richly deserves. Long live Advani ji, Long live BJP, Jai Hind!"" he said. Sinha's proximity to Advani is nothing new and many believe that it was due this closeness the current party leadership has sidelined the Patna Sahib MP. Shatrughan Sinha has attacked his own party over various issues via cryptic tweets but the BJP has avoided taking any action against him so far. Recently, he came out in support of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and slammed those who indulge in negative politics and mudslinging on political opponents. ""Enough of negative politics and mudslinging by opponents on our political leaders, be it Kejriwal, Laloo Yadav or Sushil Modi,"" Shatrughan Sinha tweeted.""Our BJP surely believes in honesty and transparency, which seldom go together, but must go together. An allegation is ONLY THAT unless proved,"" he said.ALSO READ:In series of tweets, BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha praises Arvind Kejriwal, calls for end to negative politics, mudslinging"

The ""suicide"" tapes - are believed to have recorded in 1991 with the help of a friend - and have remained secret for 20 years, The Sun reported.

""I was so depressed, and I was trying to cut my wrists with razor blades. It rained and rained and rained.

3014,Hindu Sena throws b'day bash for 'Saviour of Humanity' Trump,"At 1 pm today, New Delhi's Jantar Mantar will witness a big birthday bash thrown by the right-wing group Hindu Sena in honour of United States President Donald Trump, or as they like to call him, the ""Saviour of Humanity.""Invites to the birthday celebration were circulated by Hindu Sena, which terms itself an 'independent non-profit organisation for Hindu causes', on social media.Posting the invite on Twitter, the group's national president Vishnu Gupta said, ""I'd like to invite you all for Birthday Celebration of our beloved Mr. @realDonaldTrump President of #USA & Saviour of Humanity on 14/06/17"". The invite, which also carries a photo of Donald Trump as a child (it's real), doesn't mention what the festivities at Jantar Mantar will entail. But, the invite does promise a photo exhibition, presumably on the life and times of President Trump.Also, if the Hindu Sena's Trump birthday celebration from last year is to be considered, there will be a decorative cake involved. This is not the first time the Hindu Sena has organised an event around Donald Trump, who turns 70 today. In May last year, the group held a havan, again at Jantar Mantar, praying for Donald Trump's victory in the then upcoming United States presidential election.Later that year in November, just days before the US election, the Hindu Sena pre-emptively celebrated the Republican Trump's victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. MEANWHILE, IN THE USWhile the Hindu Sena is organising a birthday party for Trump at New Delhi's favourite protest site, there is an actual march being planned in New York City to protest the US president's very birth.A group called Rise and Resist, which was formed after Trump was voted to power in November last year, has called on citizens in New York City to march to Trump Tower and hold demonstrations. The group also plans to give him a gift: a plane ticket to Russia (the Trump campaign is being investigated for colluding with the Russian government during the US presidential election). The group's event page on its website says, ""Rise and Resist will be protesting Trump's birthday by marching to Trump Tower in New York and delivering his present: one-way tickets to Russia.""While there is no official word on whether and how Donald Trump will be celebrating his birthday, news agency AFP reported that wife Melania has asked supporters to sign a birthday card the US president will ""never forget""."

3027,Cars may predict if driver is having a heart attack,"Washington, Jun 13 (PTI) Scientists are developing a new system that can predict if a car driver is about to have a heart attack, a feature that would help avoid road accidents due to an unexpected cardiac event. When a person has a medical emergency behind the wheel, fellow passengers and motorists also face risk of death or serious injury. ""A large number of traffic incidents are caused by medical conditions while driving, specifically cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infraction and myocardial ischemia,"" said Kayvan Najarian, from University of Michigan in the US. ""The medical event interferes with the drivers ability to safely drive and operate the car, causing the accident,"" said Najarian. Researchers, in collaboration with Japanese automotive manufacturer Toyota, wanted to move towards technology that can monitor and analyse the physiology of the person driving and predict if they are going to have adverse cardiac events. ""We identified the challenges, potential solutions, hardware options and algorithmic approaches that could be potentially used,"" Najarian said. ""We concluded that cardiac events were conditions that are more feasible to detect with technology in the vehicle,"" he added. Researchers are creating a system that could be placed in the vehicle to monitor and predict an adverse cardiac event. ""We would like to test hardware we had previously identified, and improve and validate our algorithmic solutions to see what it will take to generate a system that could look at the physiology of a person, provided by high-density electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, as well as other medical measurements,"" Najarian said. Their goal is to come up with a system that would predict the occurrence of adverse cardiac events in real time. Researchers are using machine-learning models to analyse the data collected from in-hospital and in-vehicle subjects. The research team will then test the system on real-time prediction of cardiac events. ""There are actually quite a few obstacles that were identified,"" Najarian said. ""You cant have clinical-grade monitoring devices in the vehicle. You need to use a high-quality monitoring device in the vehicle that, despite all the in-vehicle noise, could reliably register the drivers ECG without being large and obtrusive,"" he added. The research team will begin gathering the physiological data from the driver using heart monitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Such monitors are patches placed on the drivers chest that analyse physiological data in real time. "

Once the peahen shows her willingness, the peacock mounts on the peahen and fertilises the eggs through muscular spasms"".The Choolannur sanctuary has close to 300 pea fowls. It was established in 2007 and named after famous ornithologist Induchoodan or K K Neelakantan.These days, the sanctuary has become a school for those who want to learn about the mating habits of peacocks.

3030,Complaint against Diljit Dosanjh for glorifying dog fights,"Popular Punjabi singers Diljit Dosanjh and Kamal Grewal may find themselves in trouble for 'glorifying dog fights' in their latest album videos and songs.Animal rights activists have set up a page on Facebook called 'Exposing Animal Fights in India', whereby they have uploaded more than 100 secretly-captured videos of the 'canine blood sport.'This sport is hugely popular in parts of Punjab and Haryana such as Bhatinda, Ludhiana, Hisar, Fatehabad, Gurgaon and held clandestinely in several farmhouses in Delhi. Breeds such as pittbulls, bull dogs, Indian mastiffs and other pedigree dogs are especially bred and trained to be ferocious to the point of being lethal and kill other dogs in wrestling-kind of rings.Alongside, the dog lovers have also uploaded a song each of Diljit Dosanjh called 'Pitbull' and Kamal Grewal's 'Sarkari Ban' where both seem to be promoting the illegal activity.While Dosanjh, who is himself seen handling pitbulls in the video, says, ""Rakhe fight nu vi Pitbull chaar ni"" (Have kept four pitbulls for fighting), Grewal in his song called 'Sarkari Ban' says, ""Petbull'an da chalaya yaaran ne hai daur ni"" (Friends have begun the trend of pitbull fighting)."" He is also seen making two unruly dogs fight with mouth guards on.Grewal also seems to praise sports like bull racing and pigeon fights (kabutarbaazi), which also comes under the Gambling Act other than Prevention of Animal Cruelty Act and IPC Section 429 for killing and maiming animals.COMPLAINTS FILEDAbhinav Srihan of NGO Fauna Police says, ""We strongly condemn this. It is wrong to project dog fights as something macho, valiant or courageous. Punjab has historically been known for healthy human sports like kushti and kabaddi. The Sikh Regiment in Indian Army has won maximum awards for their true heroism, and our Gurus have also taught compassion for all.""""It is sad that things have come to a point where we make dogs fight and set this as an example for the youth,"" he added.Few dog lovers have already forwarded complaints to the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) regarding singers Dosanjh, Grewal and some more small-time singers also. The complainants say that some singers are not just promoting animal cruelty, but drugs consumption and use of illegal firearms through their explicit videos, as well.The AWBI has taken cognizance of these complaints and written letters to Punjab Police for action. Strangely, singer Kamal Grewal responded to one of these FB posts saying, ""How can a song, which is itself named 'Sarkari Ban' be banned by the authorities."" Diljit Dosanjh, on the other hand, did not respond to the criticism on FB despite being tagged.Earlier, Union minister for women and child welfare Maneka Gandhi had said that she was aware of this cruel sport. ""Dogs are starved for days. Their tails and ears are cut off. They are made violent for such fights, and when one dog loses, it is shot dead by the owner. It is a very sad state of affairs,"" she had told the media."

3041,Beef festival organised in Aizawl as Rajnath visits Mizoram,"Opposing the recent notification of the Centre banning sale of cattle for slaughter in animal markets, which is being widely perceived as beef ban, some activists today organised a beef festival in Mizoram capital Aizawl. The beef festival coincides with the visit of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who arrived in Aizawl today to hold a meeting of chief ministers of the states sharing borders with Mynamar.The security arrangement for Rajnath Singh's visit to Aizawl was beefed up in the wake of beef festival organised by ZOlife Group and some activists. The organisers promoted the event on Facebook asking people to attend the beef festival at Vanapa Hall in Aizawl. It was scheduled for 2 pm today.CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR BJPThe opposition to the Centre's notification assumes political significance for the BJP, which is focusing on improving its presence in the entire North-East. Remruata Varte, one of the organizers said that the entire state stands together in opposing the 'beef ban' by BJP government at the Centre.Beef is an integral part of the food habits of the people in the region and no one will compromise for the same, Varte said.This of course comes as a big set-back for the BJP leaders who have been camping in the region trying to garner support for impending elections in the state. Earlier, protests were witnessed in Meghalaya against the Centre's notification for ban on sale of cattle for slaughter at animal markets.(Photo credit: Lal Hmingmawia and Remruata Varte in Aizawl, Mizoram) ALSO READ | "
3042,Snake of longest python species lays 28 eggs in Kolkata zoo,"Three pythons in Kolkata's Alipore Zoo gave birth to 56 snakelings, thanks to the efforts of a team of skilled snake breeders hired by the zoo. Interestingly, all three pythons were of three separate species - Rock, Burmese and Reticulated.The Rock python laid two eggs, both of which hatched. The Burmese python laid 41 eggs in March of which 34 hatched in April. The Reticulated python laid 28 eggs, of which 20 hatched.Reticulated python is the longest snake species in the world and heaviest among the three.EGGS PRESERVED CAREFULLY These eggs were collected and sealed using various materials and carefully preserved at 30-33 degrees Celsius.Usually the number of eggs laid in one go is between 10-15 but this marks a bumper breeding for Alipore Zoo officials to boast about it.Ashish Kumar Samanta, Director Alipore Zoo explained, ""We are very proud. We have made history. This is due to the sincere efforts of the team. The Burmese python laid around 35 eggs, the Reticulated python laid 20 eggs, and the Rock python laid two eggs. We carefully sealed the eggs and monitored the temperature conditions.""In this case the heat could have played a spoilsport but it was the use of technology and precision that has created history with the longest snake laying the highest number of eggs in Kolkata.

The meeting will be PM Modi's first with Trump whose took over as the president on January 20.The meeting between the two leaders who have spoken over the phone at least thrice since the latter assumed office, comes at a time when Trump made critical comments about India while announcing America's decision to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. President Donald Trump has accused India and other countries of trying to extract ""billions and billions and billions"" of dollars in foreign aid from the developed world to sign up for the climate accord.MODI'S DISCUSSIONS WITH TRUMPIn spite of the difference on some issues, Modi's discussions with Trump are likely to find a common approach on matters related to South Asia, particularly the rise in infiltration from the neighbouring Pakistan, terrorism and India's case for a seat at the nuclear supplier's group. Modi has reiterated India's support to the Paris agreement and said he is willing to go further than what has been committed under the Paris accord.Both the leaders will hold discussions on taking the bilateral ties to a new level, convergence of strategic interests in South Asia, joint effort in fighting terrorism, trade and specifically the vexed issue of H-1B temporary visa, the biggest concern for New Delhi.Moreover, US National Security Adviser (NSA) Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster has re-affirmed India's position as the US' ""major defence partner"" during talks with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Lieutenant General McMaster had discussed bilateral ties, situation in the South Asian region including Afghanistan and Pakistan with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his April visit.Under the previous administration, Prime Minister Modi had a record eight meetings with former US President Barack Obama.On the US executive order on H-1B visas, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has reportedly hit back at the United States on the H-1B visa issue and said that their companies in India will also be affected. She has said that it is not only the Indian companies which will get affected but also the US companies who earn profits which go to their economy.(With inputs from ANI)Also Read:India leading polluter, says US President Donald Trump while pulling out of Paris climate accordNarendra Modi in Paris: Climate deal shared legacy of world, article of faith for India"

3046,Gujarat BJP ministers spark row for meeting 100 exorcists,"Two Gujarat ministers courted controversy this weekend after they were spotted at an event meant to felicitate exorcists in Botad district's Gadhada village. According to a report by Tv9 Gujarati, Education and Revenue Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Atmaram Parmar were sitting on the dais of the event that also saw two exorcists beat themselves with metal chains to Gujarati music.The ministers triggered controversy after a video clip of them at the event went viral. Chudasama, however, defended his presence, saying it was just a gathering of 'worshippers of the divine'. According to news agency PTI, the event was organised by a local unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party and also saw participation from the area's MLA. PTI also reported that the the two ministers were seen shaking hands with around 100 exorcists who were present at the felicitation ceremony. Jayant Pandya, a prominent rationalist and the chief of the NGO Bharat Jan Vigyan Jatha, sharply criticised the two ministers, calling their presence at the event shameful. Speaking to Tv9 Gujarati, Padnya said his organisation condemns the episode and added that this was the first time he saw high-ranking government functionaries attending such an event.'(My NGO) has decided to write to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and urge him to ensure that cabinet ministers do not attend such events and promote (superstitious) practices,' Pandya told the Gujarati TV channel. Unfazed by the criticism, Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama defended his and his colleague's presence at the exorcists' event. PTI quoted Chudasama as saying, ""I attended the programme because it was a gathering of worshippers of divine power, not those who spread superstition."""

3048,Indian Railways mulls Metro-like self-propelled trains,"Racing against time to bring a network of ""high-speed corridors"" on track, the Indian Railways is exploring self-propelled train sets similar to those used in Delhi Metro.This technology, experts say, will not only achieve faster acceleration of up to 160 km per hour, but also put in place advance protective measures like electro-pneumatic braking system to improve passenger safety.Senior railway officials said the prototype of the train is being manufactured at Integral Coach Factory in Chennai and the first two sets will be ready by March 2018. The trial runs will begin soon thereafter.A top railway ministry official told Mail Today that the Chennai coach factory has already issued a global tender for technical support for the new trains. MADE IN INDIA""These self-propelled trains will be made in India. This will reduce the manufacturing cost to nearly half the cost of importing them from foreign countries. Apart from the passenger comfort, emphasis will be on safety of the trains while they run at high speed,"" the official said.The Chennai factory is looking to equip the train sets with improved mechanical couplers and modern bogies that will support its movement at high speed. ""This will help keep the jerks and vibrations at bay,"" officials associated with the project said.""The train will have fully suspended traction motors, pneumatic secondary suspension and anti-roll bar. The brake system will be Electro Pneumatic, which will reduce the braking distance, so that full speed potential of the train can be harnessed,"" the officials said.The new technology, which comprises electro-pneumatic (EP) brake system, has an edge over the conventional air brake mechanism in terms of speed of control and quick on-vehicle reaction times.The EP brake takes less time to respond giving the loco pilot instant control of the entire train. Experts said it was originally designed for subways or metro trains but over the years the system has been widely used in leading train networks across the globe. Its speed of operation also makes it ideal for automatic train operation (ATO).For operating trains at the speed of 160 km per hour, the biggest challenge before railways is to modify its existing tracks. This includes removing sharp curves and barricading along the route so that trains can attain high speed without any physical obstructions.MODI'S DREAM PROJECTA network of high speed corridors is the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi but so far only Delhi-Agra corridor has become operational. Gatimaan Express, India's fastest train that runs at the speed of 160 km per hour, runs on the corridor.Eight other semi-high speed corridors have been proposed across the country but these are still in the conception stage. Railways has also formed a separate entity, High Speed Rail Corporation (HSRC) for speedy execution of these projects.The railways has also started the work to convert two of the busiest routes -- Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah -- into semi-high speed corridors. The maximum speed of trains on these rail routes will increase by 30 km per hour that will cut short the travel time to Mumbai and Kolkata by up to 5 hours.As per the plan, the top speed of Rajdhani Express on these routes will be increased from the current 130 kmph to 160 kmph. Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has instructed railway officials to execute the two projects on priority basis."

3050,Don't wish to seek re-appointment: Attorney General Rohatgi,"New Delhi, Jun 11 (PTI) Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, whose three-year tenure will end on June 19, has asked the government not to consider him for reappointment to the post. Rohatgi told PTI that he had written to the government last month conveying his wish to discontinue as Attorney General and return to private practice. He said the extension given to him by the government earlier this month was ""adhoc"", till further orders, as it was done when the Prime Minister was on a visit to Russia. ""So, the government has to take a call on my decision,"" he said. Rohatgi said that he maintained a ""good relationship"" with the government and would come to its aid as and when required. He said he was appointed by the Narendra Modi government after it came to power in May 2014 and he has served his term to his full satisfaction. He said he considers this duration as the top law officer enough and does not want to be considered for reappointment. ""I have conveyed to the government last month that I dont wish to seek re-appointment. I consider the three-year term as enough and I had also served the previous BJP government for five years. I would like to return to private practice,"" Rohatgi told PTI. He clarified that his letter conveying his decision not to seek reappointment should not be considered as resignation as his term is due to end. ""I will come to the aid of the government as long as I live,"" he said. Asked about his response if Prime Minister Narendra Modi insists that he continue, Rohatgi said, ""I will cross the bridge when it comes."" Besides Rohatgi, two additional solicitor generals P S Patwalia and Neeraj Kishan Kaul have also preferred not to seek reappointment as law officers. Rohatgi was appointed as the AG on June 19, 2014 immediately after the BJP government came to power in May that year. During his three-year stint, he argued many contentious matters like the challenge to NJAC Act on appointment of judges for the higher judiciary. He also defended the government which was in tussle with the Supreme Court Collegium of judges on the appointment of judges for higher judiciary. Recently, he assisted the apex court in triple talaq matter in which the judgement is reserved. He has also advanced the governments stand of defending the policy of Aadhaar in which the issue of Right to Privacy has been raised and is pending before apex court. As a top law officer, Rohatgi defended the governments policy of demonetisation in which the high denomination currency of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 were declared as not a legal tender. "

3052,Women beat up molesters with slippers in Gurugram,"Not unfamiliar with late-hour spectacles, Gurgaon's Mall Mile, a one-km stretch dotted with shopping malls and night clubs, was witness to yet another eventful night on Saturday - albeit with a twist. A group of women pub workers, fed up with obscene gestures and physical assault by a few men, took out their slippers to teach their tormentors a lesson.The brawl was captured by several onlookers on their mobile phones and these clips are now in circulation on social media. The half-hour high drama makes a mockery of Gurugram Police's claims of night patrol at the stretch, which has been in news for open sex trade and crimes against women.MISSING POLICE PRESENCE""There was hardly any police presence on MG Road when this incident happened. Onlookers were busy shooting the fight on their cameras,"" BN Lal, an eye-witness and a resident of the area, told Mail Today. ""While sex deals taking place on the (MG) road are an open secret, police patrolling is seen only after a major crime is highlighted in the media. A few weeks later, it is business as usual,"" Lal added. Several eyewitnesses said the ""ugly episode"" took place around 1 AM when a group of four to five women, apparently working with the various pubs in the vicinity, were waiting outside Sahara Mall for transport. ""Some drunk men repeatedly made obscene gestures to the women and one of them approached them. This was followed by heated arguments and commotion, which made the men leave the spot,"" said one of the eyewitnesses, requesting anonymity.""However, these men, about a dozen in count, returned five-ten minutes later and again approached one of the younger women in the group,"" said the eyewitness. ""They must have been emboldened by the absence of any police patrol vehicle in the area.""Lal said a fresh round of arguments began after which one of the men tried to pull one of the women to where his vehicle was parked. The scuffle sparked anxiety among other women who rushed to help their colleague.SLIPPERS FLY""One of them took out his slipper and waved at the assailant. In a flash, all the women took off their footwear and began beating up the harasser. His friends came to help him but they also received the same treatment,"" Lal said. ""As a crowd gathered, the men ran away in their vehicles.""There are seven night clubs in Sahara Mall and each has the capacity of hosting about 100 guests. Local residents complain that at 1 AM, when these pubs down shutters, MG road gets crowded with groups of drunk men who are a nuisance. ""The situation is worst on weekends,"" said a resident.A security guard at the mall, who refused to be named, said when the patrons come out of these night clubs, they try to strike deals with women, some of whom are regular employees and others who facilitate entry to stag pub-goers. ""Such brawls usually occur when either a deal goes wrong or regular women employees are inappropriately approached. The Saturday incident seems to be the latter case,"" said the guard. ""When Gurgaon Police are around, there is little nuisance but when the patrol party is absent, such arguments are common. Only this time, the molesters were at the receiving end,"" the guard added.There are 15 night clubs in various malls on the stretch. Residents said they have approached the district administration but it has failed to come with an effective strategy to deal with the weekly ruckus. ""Pub owners must be held accountable for such incidents. They must ensure that female guests or staff leave their premises safely,"" said a local resident.City police tried to wash their hands of the matter by saying that such incidents were more of a social problem then a crime. Manish Sehgal, ACP (crime) of Gurugram Police said, ""We have deployed policemen and women in civil uniform to identify miscreants. There are regular drives to nab troublemakers.""Sehgal said the police are yet to receive any complaint in the case and will take appropriate action if they are approached by the victims."
3053,"GST should not be rolled out with 'jugaad', says Minister","New Delhi, Jun 11 (PTI) The worlds largest fiscal reform, Goods and Services Tax (GST), should not be implemented with ""jugaad"" and the rollout date for the new indirect tax regime should be postponed by a month, West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said today. He said West Bengal has been the ""pioneer"" in seeking GST implementation, but the regime should be such that common man and small traders benefit alike. ""I have also added a caveat (in the Council meeting) that July 1 looks extremely difficult. But you cannot do Jugaad for worlds largest fiscal reform called GST,"" Mitra told reporters after the 16th meeting of the GST Council here. He said that a small business has to fill up spreadsheet which then has to go through a software process to get uplinked. Reports suggest that the formats of these would be made available only by the end of this month. ""...And you are going to start GST from July 1. So my submission was, let us not do jugaad for something which is worlds largest fiscal reform,"" he said, adding that its rollout should be ""postponed by one month or so"". Asked if West Bengal is ready for a July 1 rollout, Mitra said there is still one more meeting of the GST Council on June 18 during which the preparedness will be assessed. ""Whenever we are prepared fully to our satisfaction, everybody feels comfortable, we can go ahead,"" he said. In the meeting today, the GST Council decided that traders, manufacturers and restaurant owners with turnover of up to Rs 75 lakh can opt for a composition scheme and pay taxes at the rate of 1, 2, and 5 per cent respectively. Earlier, the Council had decided on a turnover limit of Rs 50 lakh. Besides, movie tickets costing up to Rs 100 will now attract 18 per cent tax, as against 28 per cent proposed earlier, while those above Rs 100 will continue to attract 28 per cent GST. Mitra termed increasing the turnover limit for availing composition scheme and reduction in tax rates for cinema tickets as ""people centric measures"". "
3054,Banks told to give all details on Mallya-Kingfisher bad loan,"In a landmark judgment, the information watchdog Central Information Commission (CIC) has directed a consortium of banks that lent a bad loan to embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines to reveal all the details of not just the loan the company defaulted on, but such information about the approval of the loan that is expected to land several top bank officials in a legal soup.Hailing it as a big victory, RTI activist Harinder Dhingra told Mail Today that it was a lesson to such public authorities and institutions that tried to hide behind the exemption clauses in the RTI Act to ensconse their ""wrongdoings"".The consortium had denied Dhingra much of information about the process that led to ""unwarranted"" granting of loan that eventually went bad.""It is strange that innocuous information pertaining to public money was denied in the name of hampering investigation. It is also strange that the bank does not know of what happened to the money it lent to the company. It doesn't know if the company has been declared a defaulter,"" said Dhingra.While Mail Today was the first to report that such a loan, nearly Rs 55 crore, had been given to Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines by the Oriental Bank of Commerce-led consortium, the latter had been stonewalling giving information regarding who approved the loan and on what grounds, such as collaterals etc, by invoking Section 8 (1) (h) of the RTI Act. The bank had argued that the matter was pending before different investigating agencies and disclosure of the information could hamper the investigation process. The concerned enforcement agencies are the CBI, ED and the SFIO.SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTThe CIC had earlier, at the case hearing on February 10, questioned the invoking of the exemption clause. In its latest judgment in the case, the CIC quoted several judgments from the Supreme Court as well as the Delhi High Court and observed that the bank had to furnish information asked by Dhingra and that the exemption did not apply.IC Sharat Sabharwal observed: ""Except for stating that the matter is under investigation of some agencies, the respondents (bank) have not made any other submission to justify invocation of Section 8 (1) (h) to deny most of the information and why its disclosure would hamper the investigation process. As stated above, the investigation agencies have chosen not to make any submission in spite of an opportunity given to them for the purpose.""The IC also cited that the exemption clause itself made it clear that ""a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.""The IC also quoted, among others, an SC observation in the case of UP Financial Corporation vs gem Cap India Pvt (AIR 1993, 1435). ""In fact, information about industrialists who are loan defaulters of the country may put pressure on such persons to pay their dues."""
3055,80-yr-old woman beaten by MP cops for 'sheltering agitators',"An 80-year-old woman in Bhopal has alleged that a group of four-five policemen barged into her house and beat her with sticks, breaking her bones and grievously injuring her husband too.

3057,Gambler lost ?57 lakh after betting on 'unlosable' UK PM May,"London, Jun 11 (PTI) It seems that British Prime Minister Theresa May was not the only one who lost big in the UK polls. A punter lost a whopping 70,000 pounds betting on a Tory majority, believing the election was ""unlosable"" for May. British bookmaker William Hill took the wager from an unnamed punter shortly after the Conservatives crushed Labour in Mays local elections. The person was one of many who apparently believed the upcoming general election to be ""unlosable"", the bookmaker was quoted as saying by The Independent. The Prime Minister was riding high with a seemingly unassailable double-digit lead over Labours Jeremy Corbyn in the polls and the only question on pundits minds seemed to be, ""how big will the landslide be?"" Bookmakers hailed a bumper evening as large numbers of people placed big bets on the Conservatives to romp to a convincing victory which was not to be. William Hill said around 20 million pounds was wagered, the majority of it backing the Tories. Joe Crilly, a spokesperson for the bookmaker, was quoted as saying that, ""The general election result was a good one for us bookies as the Tories managed to fluff their lines in what was being billed as the unlosable election."" ""We had a number of five figure bets on the Conservatives winning a majority, with some wagers at prices as short as 1/16, although one punter from London will be breathing a sigh of relief after backing the Conservatives to win the most seats to the tune of 200,000 pounds,"" he said.

3058,India's first underwater metro to come up in Kolkata,"Kolkata will soon have an underwater Metro which will pass through tunnels several feet under the Hooghly. The first underwater transportation tunnel of India is ready with the second one nearing completion. The Kolkata Metro transportation tunnel is unique to India because never before in the history of the country has a tunnel been made under a flowing river.The tunnel has been constructed 30 metres below riverbed, just a few metres away from the famous Howrah Bridge, built in the last century to connect Howrah and Kolkata. There aren't even roads that are under a river in India making the Kolkata Metro tunnel a complete technology marvel which will see trains will chugging through it every two and a half minutes.""It will be connecting two main terminals: Howrah and Sealdah - each of which has a footfall of about 10-12 lakh passengers per day. These type of tunnel-boring machines, which we call 'earth pressure balancing tunnel boring machines', have been used for the first time in Eastern India,"" said Satish Kumar, Managing Director of Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.Another interesting point is that more than 10 lakh tonne of mud has been dug out for the construction of this tunnel. The tunnel-boring machines were used for the first time in eastern India.The entire 16.6-kilometre stretch of the first tunnel is ready. The second tunnel is yet to be completed. Of the entire length, 10.8 kms is underground and around one kilometre is underwater..""For tunnelling below the river, the water tightness, waterproofing, and the design of gaskets were the major challenges, because the tunnel is being constructed for a service of 120 years, so we cannot afford any water leakage during service,"" said Kumar.Tunnelling cannot be done for long hence the homework was done for almost an year and then the machines and equipment shifted to the location for final implementation and execution of the plan. The material used gives it immunity to survive quakes in seismic zone 3, in which Kolkata falls.The use of the standard gauge makes it a unique one. It is the latest technology that has been utilised to ensure that the tracks have sharp curves, keeping in mind that this tunnel passes under a lot of heritage buildings.The heritage buildings had to be protected, and the work was not supposed to stop even for a day in these buildings.

3059,"Gave birth to boy, hospital handed us girl: Delhi couple","Is it a boy or a girl? Sonia Prajapati, 25, says she gave birth to a son on June 2 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. But the central government-run institute handed her a baby girl. She and her husband are now waiting for the report of a DNA test to end the mystery and their anguish.The hospital says the results would be in its favour and denies any possible baby switch. Sonia and her husband, Bhupender, are distraught. She is still in the gynaecology ward and keeps on looking at the empty crib next to her with tears in her eyes. She feels a little better on seeing other mothers playing with their babies.The couple lives in south Delhi's Khanpur and has lodged a complaint with the Safdarjung Police station.""Mine was a normal delivery. I am certain that I had a given birth to a baby boy and even the doctors showed me. In case this was a girl child and I was wrong, the doctors in the OT and the nursing staff should have corrected me. But they didn't. That proves that I gave birth to baby boy,"" Sonia, who teaches at the NGO Navasrishti, told Mail Today.""Also, without taking my permission, doctors here inserted Copper-T (a device used to prevent pregnancy) into my body. It is illegal. And if our DNA matches with the baby girl, I will accept her,"" Sonia added. DOC REFUTES CLAIMHowever, Dr AK Rai, director of Safdarjung Hospital, told MAIL TODAY that the couple's allegation is wrong.""We are all waiting for the DNA reports and I am sure they will be in our favour as there was no exchange of babies. The DNA reports are likely to come in 20 days and till that time the baby girl is being kept in our nursery and looked after by the nursing staff,"" he said.Dr Rai added that on June 2, only two boys were born at the hospital and the rest were girls. ""At 11am, a patient delivered a baby boy, who was premature and was sent to the nursery and the other male child was born at around 4pm, after the allegations made by Sonia (the patient) over exchange of babies,"" he said. ""How can it be possible?""The young couple waited four years for a child and is not ready to accept the ""wrong"" baby.""They have returned the child to the hospital's nursery but have not got back their own son.

3060,Pak-born London terrorist was trying for a job at Wimbledon,"security firm: report London, Jun 11 (PTI) Pakistan-born British citizen Khuram Butt, the London Bridge attack ringleader, had been trying to get a job with a security firm that provides stewards for Wimbledon and other sporting events, raising concerns whether he had considered targeting the prestigious tennis tournament. Security services and counter-terrorism police are now investigating 27-year-old Butts motive in trying to get the job with the security company, the Telegraph reported today. Citing well-placed sources, the paper said that Butt had set up the job interview with the security firm that supplies safety stewards to Wimbledon and to Premier League football clubs. The interview was scheduled to take place at the end of this month. ""One possibility is Butt had considered targeting the tennis tournament but decided to speed up the plot, following the Manchester Arena bombing, and switched the attack to London Bridge,"" the paper said. Butt had previously worked for six months on the London Underground until quitting in October. Although he was under low level investigation by MI5 and counter terrorism police, Butt was able to get a job working at Westminster station because employers are not made aware of security services concerns when performing criminal records checks, the paper said. ""The security firm would check his background but it does not have access to the police watch list or have knowledge of any MI5 investigation. There would have been no reason for him not to get the job. Butt could not only have caused serious damage but potentially helped other terrorists to get into one of these events,"" the paper said, quoting a source close to the intelligence services. Butt and his aides Moroccan-origin Rachid Redouane and Moroccon-Italian Yousef Zaghba rammed a high-speed van into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing revellers at the nearby Borough Market, killing eight people before being shot dead by armed police officers last week.

3071,Maha govt tells court it can't find own highway notification,"The Bombay High Court today was informed by the Maharashtra government pleader that it cannot find the notification classifying roads as state highways and other roads. The reason Maharashtra government is looking for this notification is because a bunch of petitions have been filed by liquor vendors and restaurant owners claiming that the excise department is now not renewing their licenses to sell or serve liquor as the department claims they are located on the highways.It was in December last year that the Supreme Court in its landmark judgment of State of Tamil Nadu V/s. K. Balu and others had directed for not issuing license to liquor shops and permit rooms within distance of 500 mtrs form the national and state highways.  By the said judgment the apex court had also directed for not renewing license of existing shops and for not issuing new license for such shops after 31st March, 2017 along national and state highways. The petitioners claim that the bars, restaurants and wine shops are neither situated on a national highway nor on a state highway, but is located in by-lanes of the city, more than 500 meters from the highways.  For example, one of the petitioners is King Wines, which is located in the heart of Kolhapur city. The petitioner submits that recently, their licenses were renewed for this year on accepting requisite license fees by the district collector and superintendent of state excise in Kolhapur. However, the same authorities, after renewal, directed the wine shop owner to forthwith, stop all their business owing to Supreme Court's order.  Thus, during the last hearing on May 31st the division bench of Justice B P Colabawalla and Justice A M Badar had asked for the notification. Advocate Shrikrishna Ganbavale who is appearing for the petitioners explained, ""There has to be a notification from state government that this road or that road is a national highway or a state highway. Without that the state government cannot arbitrarily close down business establishments. That is why they have been asked to show the notifications.""The court has granted the state government time till Monday to get these notifications and has even asked the advocate general of Maharashtra to appear before them."

3077,'Naughty' Kohli was quiet and shy in front of us: Sehwag,"Former India opener Virender Sehwag is someone who knows Virat Kohli very well, having played with him for the national team. He also had heard of the flamboyant batsman in the domestic circuit in Delhi and knew immediately that a special talent was in the making. Sehwag knows the India captain in and out and now has some interesting tales to tell about Kohli.Until Kohli became the captain of the Indian Test team, he was infamous for his brash and aggressive attitude and had quite a few run-ins with opposition players on the field. Coming from Delhi, the aggression and extreme passion for the game came naturally to him which reflected in his game as well.Sehwag though, was quite the opposite even though he hails from the same state. The Nawab of Najafgarh was always seen as a jovial character who used to sing songs while batting and made light work of the high-class bowling that he faced during his illustrious career. Even now in his career as a broadcaster, Sehwag is hilarious with his commentary and doesn't like to mince his words.Sehwag, in a recent show with Star Sports, narrated a particular story about Kohli where he revealed how he used to behave like a shy youngster in front of the seniors but was the complete opposite during his U-19 days.""He was a shy and quite youngster in front of us senior players but when he was in the U-19 team he used to be very very naughty. I've heard a lot of stories about how naughty he was him from his U-19 coach Ajit Chaudhary.""Once Chaudhary told me that Kohli fell ill or was play acting so his coach told him that he wouldn't play in the next match. And suddenly Kohli's fever went away and he became absolutely fine after hearing that, started batting normally the way he does in the nets also. He played the next match and smashed a double hundred,"" Sehwag told Star Sports in an interview.Sehwag also recalled the time he heard about Kohli for the first time and what he thought of the future India captain the first time he saw him bat live."

If you have to talk about it to the whole world, even for Ayurveda we know it is well defined and good and people can live for hundred years, but we have to scientifically validate it to prove it to the rest of the world.

3082,India signs pact to check tax evasion by multinational firms,"New Delhi, Jun 7 (PTI) India today signed the OECD multilateral convention that aims to check cross-border tax evasion by multinational companies. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley signed the multilateral convention in Paris to implement tax treaty- related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting. More than 65 countries, including India, signed the convention. More countries are expected to sign the convention in coming days, a finance ministry statement said. ""The Convention will modify Indias treaties in order to curb revenue loss through treaty abuse and base erosion and profit shifting strategies by ensuring that profits are taxed where substantive economic activities generating the profits are carried out and where value is created,"" the statement added. The Multilateral Convention is an outcome of the OECD/G20 Project to tackle Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) which is resorted to by MNCs through tax planning strategies by exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules. It helps them artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations, resulting in little or no overall corporate tax being paid. The BEPS Project identified 15 actions to address BEPS in a comprehensive manner, the statement said. India was part of the Ad Hoc Group of more than 100 countries and jurisdictions from G20, OECD, BEPS associates and other interested countries, which worked on an equal footing on the finalisation of the text of the Multilateral Convention, starting May, 2015. The Convention enables all signatories to meet treaty- related minimum standards that were agreed as part of the final BEPS package, including the minimum standard for the prevention of treaty abuse under Action 6.

As the news spread, neighbours and people from nearby villages visited Sarvesh's house to meet the note-munching goat. The farmer said people gave him numerous solutions to recover the notes. Some even advised Sarvesh to sell it to a butcher. Some were of the view that the goat should be handed over to the police.

3112,6-month deadline to probe corruption cases on govt employees,"New Delhi, Jun 5 (PTI) Changing an over 50-year-old rule, the government has set a deadline of six months to complete probe in corruption cases involving its employees. The decision has been taken to speed up the investigation in such cases, most of them pending for quiet a long time. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has amended Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, and decided time-line for critical stages of investigation and enquiry proceedings. The Inquiring Authority should conclude the inquiry and submit its report within a period of six months, says the amended rules. However, an extension for a period not exceeding six months at a time may be allowed for any good and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing by the disciplinary authority, it said. Earlier, there was no time-frame to complete an enquiry. The disciplinary authority shall deliver to a government servant, accused of irregularity and corruption, a copy of the articles of charge, the statement of the imputations of misconduct or misbehaviour and a list of documents and witnesses by which each article or charges is proposed to be sustained, the new rules said. On receipt of such articles of charge, the government servant shall be required to submit his written statement of defence, if he so desires, and also state whether he desires to be heard in person, within a period of 15 days, it said. The time-limit can, however, be extended for a period not exceeding fifteen days. But under no circumstances, the extension of time for filing written statement of defence shall exceed forty-five days from the date of receipt of articles of charge, the rules said. At present, there is no time-limit for submission of the employees statement of defence. The new rules are applicable to all category of employees excluding those in all-India services--Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS)-- and a few other categories of officers. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), in a directive, had last year expressed serious concern over delay in finalising corruption cases and asked all departments to complete these inquiries within a maximum period of six months to keep away ""nothing will change"" notion associated with governance.

While delivering the order, principal judge of family court Dharmesh Sharma observed that the slow pace of the justice delivery system ""casts a very sickening feeling in my mind"" but added that the parties and their counsel too were perhaps responsible for the delay. Millions of cases are pending in India's courts, draining litigants of resources and pointing towards an urgent need for more judges and judicial reforms. Courts too are encouraging such couples to first try mediation instead of getting into lengthy legal fights.DECISION AFTER 19 YEARS""Unfortunate as it may look, this case is coming up for final decision after nineteen years of its institution initially before the family court. Most unfortunate aspect of this case is that the parties cohabited hardly for about 20 days before calamity struck the newly married bride, having pernicious repercussions on the mindset of her husband,"" said the judge.""The marriage has irretrievably broken down despite the fact the parties are quite educated and hail from an affluent class of the society, and I only wish they should have settled their differences in an amicable manner instead of suffering the agony of a protracted matrimonial litigation.""

She was allegedly involved in a case of misappropriation of funds.The woman, who was then 29, was brought to Delhi for trial. On the last day of the remand, she told her husband that she was carrying his child. The man moved court, seeking dissolution of marriage on the grounds that following the arrest of his wife, he was interrogated by the police on a number of occasions. Inquiries were conducted at his workplace and his accounts were checked, causing deep mental and physical cruelty, making him subject of ridicule among his friends, colleagues and relatives, he argued.The husband also told the court that he learnt later that his wife had hidden her professional qualifications and other important details. He said the incident left him in constant tension, apprehending that he may be called by the police at any time for further investigation and sought divorce on the grounds of ""cruelty"".WOMAN DENIES ALLEGATIONSThe wife though claimed that all the allegations against her were false. She also said the couple had consummated before the completing the religious ritual. The wife did not deny the criminal proceedings initiated against her but said she was being falsely implicated in the case by her employer.She also said that her husband not only abandoned her at a time when she needed him the most but also abandoned the child born in wedlock and left them to fend for themselves.The court granted divorce, saying that the arrest, detention and criminal prosecution of the wife, whether innocent or not of the charges, so early into their marriage caused the husband exceptional hardship and was inflicted with intolerable mental cruelty. ""Protracted legal battles in our system end up spoiling a person's life,"" Saurabh Chauhan, counsel for the husband, told Mail Today. ""A marriage going bad is an accident. It can happen to anyone.THE STATE OF THE COUPLE NOWHad the divorce been granted in a year or two, my client could have remarried and have had a family now and led a normal life. He is an old man now and not in a state to marry. Instead of getting relief, the long battles themselves become the problem.""Mail Today has learnt that the husband has moved abroad and works in a bank while the wife is working as an accountant. Their daughter passed class 12 this year and scored 94 per cent in the board examinations.Anil Sharma, counsel for the wife, told that they have moved the high court in appeal.

He also never took care of the daughter's expenses. The woman has brought up the girl singlehandedly,"" he said."
3116,"NIT Srinagar site hacked, hackers demand 'Free Kashmir'","In an unfortunate series of events that unfolded in the Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan tie in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 at Edgbaston that left the neighbours' nose bloodied, pro-Kashmir elements hacked the official website of the premier National Institute of Technology (NIT) based in Srinagar on Monday, calling for an Azaad Kashmir.NIT Srinagar became a target perhaps for the fact that it had hit headlines after a clash between Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri students last year when the latter cheered India's defeat in the T20 World Cup match against West Indies. The servers were downed after the attack.While the nation was busy grappling with an early-morning terrorist attack on a CRPF station at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Kashmir, which was foiled by jawans and left four terrorists dead, pro-Kashmir freedom elements, most probably from across the border, hacked the website of the premier institute and posted, ""Ask for milk, we shall give you sweets. Ask for Kashmir we shall kill you."" This, ironically, has been the clarion call of the Right wing, which it employs towards those asking for Kashmir's freedom.""We saw that the website had been hacked when some students tried to access it to see a few articles of the syllabus. We were shocked to see that the website bore anti-India literature, anti-Indian Armed Forces propaganda and a call to leave Kashmir and give it freedom,"" one of the students told Mail Today.WHAT THE POSTERS SAID The posters, uploaded in the name of one 'All Pak Cyber Skullz Members', said. ""We shall fight till the last breath. What shall a man not pay for living? Everyday 100s of innocent people are abused, raped and even killed in Kashmir by Indian army, a third of the deaths are children. We don't want war. Take back your guns and go back to where you came from.""""All we ask is for freedom, you can kill us, you can't kill us all, we shall not give up."" The poster went on to say: ""Giving up is not an option."" In yet another poster the hackers declared their identity as 'Hacked by SH11: Team Pak Cyber Skullz'.The poster also said, ""Go Modi Go."" To a rhetorical question - ""You know why you got hacked - which the hackers obviously wanted to answer, the poster said, ""Free Kashmir. Freedom is our goal. Kashmir does not want militarised governance. Stop killing children, raping women and imprisoning the men! They just want freedom! Freedom from the evil of the Indian Military!"""
3117,Felt I was forced to dance but started enjoying it: Siddiqui,"Mumbai, Jun 5 (PTI) Tiger Shroff said if Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who is a powerhouse performer, starts dancing as well then other actors jobs will be in trouble. Tiger has teamed up with Nawazuddin for the upcoming dance-action, ""Munna Michael"". The story is about a young man from the streets, called Munna, played by Tiger, who is a big fan of Michael Jackson. Munna teaches dancing to Mahinder Fauji, played by Nawazuddin, who is a gangster with dancing ambitions. When asked how it was to dance on screen, Nawazuddin told reporters, ""Initially I felt I was forced to do it, but I started enjoying dancing while doing the film... Dance is a passion just like acting. Its God gift to people. But I am not one of the gifted ones."" The actor was speaking at the trailer launch of the film. Tiger, who was also present at the event, quickly added, ""If he starts dancing too, humara kaam mushkil ho jayega (our jobs would be difficult). I dont think we will be able to perform as good as Nawaz sir. He is just a holistic actor. After watching the film his fans will be surprised."" Nawazuddin, 43, said he has tried to match up the dancing skills of Tiger. ""I cant be a dancing hero, but if I get a solo hero film Ill definitely do it but it shouldnt have dancing. I danced with a lot of difficulty and learnt a lot by observing Tigers dancing steps. I cant dance like him, but have tried to match him. I think I have tried to reach nearly 5 per cent of his dancing skills."" For the 27-year-old ""Heropanti"" actor, acting with Nawazuddin was intimidating but also helpful. "
3118,Mamata Banerjee plans to gift cows to farmers in West Bengal,"In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is all set to commandeer the saffron monopoly over cows and their protection. Bent on proving that cows cannot be tethered to gaushalas of a particular political hue, the chief minister has decided to gift cows to poor farmers in her state.The objective, officials associated with the initiative say, is to help small and marginal farming families supplement their incomes by selling milk and using dung to produce eco-friendly fuel and manure for organic farming. ""This will not only ensure better living conditions for the cattle population, but will generate alternative employment opportunities for farmers, especially in the unfortunate event of crop failure,"" said an agriculture department officer.Farmers in North 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts will receive the first batches of the gift cows. And going one better than the National Gokul Mission, where the Centre and state share the cost of the animals given to farmers, Mamata's government will fully fund the state's 'Godaan' scheme. That's not all. A most vocal critic of the Modi government proposal to introduce Aadhaar-like tags for cows, Mamata's government is now working on assigning UIDs (unique identification numbers) to the state's bovine population (this was apparently decided following a cow census in 2014).Paschimbanga go sampad bikash sangstha, a state body under the animal resources development department, has hired 5,174 praanimitras (friends of animals) to tag the cows. Some 1.38 million cows have already been assigned UIDs."

Luckily, there are many kids in our family, and I learnt many things from them, but I had to be careful to not over do things because it is an emotional film, and not a comedy. It couldn't have looked like a caricature or a joke.""2. The 2016 film Sultan has taken a toll on Salman Khan's health. The actor is still coping with the 'aches, pains and ligament tears'. He said in the interview, ""Post Sultan, I still have lot of aches, pain, and ligament tears. Once I sit down, it's difficult to get about.""3. Salman Khan will never move out of his flat into a bigger bungalow because he has many memories attached to his home. ""I love staying at my flat in Bandra over a big, luxurious bungalow because my parents live in the flat above mine. Ever since I was a child I have taken the same left turn or right turn and I would not have it any other way. The entire building is like one big family. When we were little, all the kids of the building would play together in the garden below and sometimes even sleep there. Back then, there weren't different houses, all the houses were treated as our own and we would go into anyone's house to eat food. I still stay in the same flat because I have countless memories attached to that house,"" Khan said in a statement recently.4. At 51, Salman is now tackling yet another 'panga': Tiger Zinda Hai and Remo D'Souza's dance film. Salman said, ""After Sultan, there was lot of pain in my body... Now I have signed Tiger Zinda Hai like a fool, I am jumping off the building, running and shooting, doing all action; I am going mad in the film. I feel one day my knee will come out. And after that I am doing Remo D'Souza's dancing film, foolish (thing). Initially I thought it's just dancing and I will have to do a bit more of dancing. I did not realise dancing today is about aerobatics and gymnastics. I am 51 years old and I have taken this panga.""5. Contrary to reports, Salman Khan has not signed ABCD 3 opposite Jacqueline Fernandez. Khan said, ""I am not doing ABCD 3, it's a Disney property. The dance film that I am doing (as an actor) and producing is different. Not all dance films are ABCD.""6. Even though Salman Khan and his Tubelight director Kabir Khan share a great rapport, Salman says he will not accept any and every film that Kabir gives him. """"After having worked with Kabir in three films we understand each other well. We share a great comfort level but that doesn't mean I will do all the films that he will offer me. If I don't like what he has offered me I won't do it, and even he won't work with me if he thinks I am not fit for a film,"" Salman said.7. About his ex-girlfriend-turned-close-friend Katrina Kaif, Salman said that it is always 'great' working with her. ""It's always great working with her. She is the hardest working actress I have ever met. She rehearses a lot, be it for dance or action sequences in a film. She has been working very hard for Tiger Zinda Hai.""8. And finally, Salman shed some light on his first crush too. ""I was 16 and there was this girl I really liked, but I could never muster the courage to tell her that. I was scared she would say no. She dated two of my friends and it didn't work out with either of them. She was a friend to me, but never liked me romantically. When others dated her, I was heartbroken. She never got to know of my feelings. She must have noticed that I was in love with her, but she was not into me. I was bummed,"" said the 51-year-old superstar."

3126,Delhi club sparks row for agreeing to host 'Bhangijumping',"The Piano Man, a popular place for Jazz music, is located in Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave. The outlet found itself in the eye of a controversy storm for agreeing to host a music band called ""Bhangijumping"". A change.org petition has been created against 'Piano Man' demanding shutting down of the ""casteist jazz club for its hate crimes against Dalits"".""Bhangi is a scheduled caste community forced into manual scavenging and sweeping work in India. The word bhangi is considered a slur used to describe 'dirty addicts' and forward castes use it on each other as an insult, as well as use it towards the Bhangi community to dehumanise and reduce their identity to something associated with 'filth'"", read the petition.Also read: The Dalits | Still untouchableThe petition said that when the meaning of 'Bhangi' was brought to the notice of club owner, Arjun Sagar Gupta, he ""offered a passive aggressive clarification justifying the name Bhangijumping as a form of 'artistic expression'"". Arjun's first Facebook post on the issue came on June 3 where he said, ""There is a gap between the artist's understanding of the word and that of some people who have reacted very negatively. I can assure you that neither the artist (who is an extremely polite and respectful person) nor The Piano Man wanted to hurt anyone, and for that, we apologise. That said, we are vehement supporters of artistic freedom and will continue to be...always.""The artist, after he learned about the fact that the name of his band could be misinterpreted and misunderstood by people, changed it to Akshay Kapoor. Talking to IndiaToday.in, Arjun said, ""It is true that we were ignorant of the fact that the word is used as a casteist slur, and I can assure you that it wasn't the artist's or The Piano Man's intent to hurt any community. It is quite sad to see that people are being oblivious to the fact that the band's name has already been changed. The Piano Man has always been an inclusive space focused on spreading love, not hatred in any form."" Many protested The Piano Man's decision to go ahead with the show, but the event was cancelled yesterday. This was announced by Arjun in another Facebook post he made on June 4 where he said, ""I think I failed to understand how deeply this has affected some people."" In the post, Arjun said, ""I think it is best for me to sit and understand the situation better. As a human being, I can make mistakes and it is my sincerest goal to learn from them and improve."" Talking to IndiaToday.in, Arjun said, ""A friend rightly pointed it out to me that the issue of casteism is so deeply ingrained that many people are oblivious to it. I've been facing a lot of backlash online and many people tell me I should have known what the word means and should not have agreed to host the band. I do understand their point but what I want everybody to know is that had I known, I would not have agreed to this and I am all for being sensitised and doing my bit in sensitising others.""

3128,Sting operation reveals Apple staff misled users on Error 53,"Australia?s consumer watchdog carried out a sting operation against Apple which it says caught staff repeatedly misleading iPhone customers about their legal rights to a free repair or replacement after a so-called ?error 53? malfunction, court documents reveal.Australian authorities lodged a high-profile case against Apple this year, after iPhone and iPad customers experienced a malfunction that rendered phones useless if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician. The fault occurred between late 2014 until early last year.The case, set to go to trial in mid-December, accuses Apple of wrongly telling customers they were not entitled to free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer.That advice was allegedly given even where the repair ? a screen replacement, for example ? was not related to the fault.Apple has so far chosen to remain silent about the case brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). But court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the company has denied the ACCC?s allegations, saying it did not mislead or cause any harm to its Australian customers.The documents also show how the ACCC used undercover methods to investigate Apple. Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.Apple?s response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.?In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider,? the ACCC?s court claim alleged. Error 53 generally occurred after a user tried to update their phone to iOS 8 or iOS 9, and affected about one in every 1,000 phones supplied by Apple or its resellers between September 2014 and February 2016. Australian consumer law clearly protects the right of a customer to a replacement or free repair if the product is faulty or of unacceptable quality. The ACCC has also alleged information on Apple US?s website misled customers about their rights. The website told users experiencing error 53 that: ?If the screen or any other part on your iPhone or iPad was replaced somewhere else, contact Apple Support about pricing information for out-of-warranty repairs.?Apple, in response, said the undercover calls made by the ACCC cannot be considered as breaches because consumer law does not exist in ?hypothetical circumstances?. The company said that real customers who had called the store would have received other information from Apple that informed them of their rights under consumer law. Apple denied the message on its US website was an ?express representation? that consumers were not entitled to a free replacement or repair. Apple said the website was referring only to the conditions of the company?s own limited warranty, which existed in addition to a customer?s statutory rights. It was only one part of the communications between the company and its customers over error 53, the company said, and must be interpreted in the broader context. Apple said it had also established an error 53 outreach program and offered replacements or repairs for many of the phones referred to in the ACCC?s case. It also released an update in February last year to resolve the problem and restore the functionality of affected devices. Apple has previously faced court action in the United States relating to error 53, but the case was thrown out last year. "
3129,Tubelight won't break records of Baahubali 2: Salman Khan,"Ever since the trailer of Salman Khan's Tubelight released, a lot has been said about how the film would probably break Baahubali 2's records at the box office. Many are of the opinion that Tubelight will be able to pull this off as Salman has a huge fan following. In fact, Salman's not-so-good friend Vivek Oberoi in a recent interview said that he wants Tubelight to break the records of Baahubali 2. He told IANS, ""I want Tubelight to break records of Baahubali and become a superhit film. I feel Tubelight has all the capacity to make Hindi cinema proud all around the world and I would like to wish all the luck for the entire team of Tubelight.""But Salman, who has collaborated with Kabir Khan for the third time, thinks otherwise. In an interview to Firstpost, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor said, ""I doubt that Tubelight will break Baahubali 2's record, because the latter is one of the most freakish films that has been made. Hindi film-goers lapped up the film despite watching a dubbed version of it. It is because of the Hindi cine-goers that they have got these numbers.""However, the actor added, ""As long as nobody loses money, I am fine. I don't feel the pressure.""Set against the backdrop of 1962 Sino-Indian war, Tubelight tells the story of two brothers. It is after a gap of seven years that Salman and brother Sohail Khan will share screen space. The film, which is set to hit the screens this Eid, also stars Chinese actor Zhu Zhu and late Om Puri. "

3132,"OnePlus 5 to launch in June with dual camera, 8 GB RAM","The OnePlus 5 is one of the most hotly anticipated handsets of the year, arguably even more than the iPhone 8. If the rumours and leaks are to be believed, then the phone may launch on June 15 itself. The smartphone will succeed One Plus 3T, which was arguably one of the best phones to launch last year. With such a glorious past, it is natural to have high hopes and expectations with the upcoming OnePlus 5. Update: Earlier we heard that the OnePlus 5 will launch on June 15. Well, at least that was the information that was leaked. Now it seems there is a new date. This latest rumour hints that the OnePlus 5 will be launched on June 20. The latest information comes courtesy leak from China where a screenshot of a image with June 20 circled has been leaked. Well, whether it is June 20 or June 15, it seems that the OnePlus 5 is just weeks away. The phone has been subjected to several leaks and rumours lately. A lot has been heard, written and spoken about the device. While the company has already confirmed few specs of the phone, a roundup of all the rumours and leaks of the phone will help you get a clearer idea of what the smartphone could bring to the table.OnePlus 5 is expected to sport a 5.5-inch display with thin bezels. Also, the phone could bear A5000 model number. While there is no word on the resolution yet but the phone could come with either 1440P or 1080P, similar to what we see in OnePlus 3T.OnePlus 5 could share its looks with OnePlus 3T. The phone may flaunt a metal unibody design with aluminium built metal frames and  rounded edges. OnePlus 5 is expected to be slimmer and compact than the OnePlus 3T. Look into the shadows. What do you 5ee? pic.twitter.com/QPQq9feIMeRecently, one of company's key officials also dismissed the rumours of OnePlus ditching the 3.5mm headphone and confirmed that the flagship phone will come with the 3.5mm headphone jack and a front-placed  fingerprint sensor. The volume and power button placed on the right side, similar to the OnePlus 3T. OnePlus 5 is expected to sport bigger battery than the  previously announced OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. There are rumours that the smartphone could come with 4000mAh battery and support for Quick Charge 4.0. It is also almost confirmed  that OnePlus 5 will come with Oxygen OS based on Android Nougat. The smartphone could come be powered by the latest Snapdragon 835 processor with Adreno 540 GPU. Rumours suggest that the smartphone could come in two storage variants- with 6G RAM and 64GB ROM and the second one with 8GB of RAM with 128GB internal storage. This is going to be the USP of OnePlus 5. The phone is expected to come with a major upgrade over its predecessor in terms of photography. India Today Tech, in its previous report, had confirmed of dual rear-camera set up which will put the phone in competition against the likes of iPhone 7 and Xiaomi Mi 6. While previous rumours hinted of only dual camera set up at the back, a recent teasers released by company starring  Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput suggests that the device might also come with dual cameras at the front. Expect a 16 MP camera, both at the front and back. The company last month entered into partnership with DxO to better the photography experience of OnePlus 5. DxO is a company best known for developing the photography benchmark test called DxOMark. OnePlus 5 could come in funky colour options like Yellow, Red, Turquoise with hint of pink and green, Gold and Black. OnePlus 5 could be priced higher than its predecessor. Reason being the dual camera set up and  latest processor but that does not mean that the phone could cost Rs 60,000 or above like the iPhone. "

3139,Indian Army to allow women in combat roles: Army Chief,"says Gen Bipin Rawat By Manash Pratim Bhuyan New Delhi, June 4 (PTI) In a transformational move, the Indian Army is all set to open up combat positions for women, a gender barrier broken by only a few countries globally. Army Chief Gen Bipin Rawat said the process to allow women in combat role, currently an exclusive domain of men, is moving fast and initially women will be recruited for positions in military police. ""I am looking at women coming as jawans. I am going to start it soon. Firstly, we will start with women as military police jawans,"" he said, giving details of the move to allow women in the male-dominated positions in the Army. Currently women are allowed in a number of select areas including in medical, legal, educational, signals and engineering wings of the Army but combat roles are kept off limit for them due to operational concerns and logistical issues. The Army Chief said he was ready to recruit women as jawans and the matter is being taken up with the government. ""We have already started the process,"" Gen Rawat told PTI in an exclusive interaction recently. He said women will have to show grit and strength in taking up challenges in combat role and shattering the glass ceiling. Very few countries including Germany, Australia, Canada, the US, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France , Norway, Sweden and Israel have allowed women in combat roles. The roles of military police include policing the cantonments and army establishments, prevent breach of rules and regulations by soldiers, maintaining movement of soldiers as well as logistics during peace and war, handling prisoners of war and extending aid to civil police whenever required.

3140,ISI agents to display Kashmir banners at Ind-Pak tie: Report,"The Inter-Services Intelligence agency plans to send as many as 14 operatives to the India-Pakistan Champions Trophy match on Sunday with the aim of displaying banners related to Kashmir, sources have told India Today. According to the sources, the agents have been asked to display A3 placards bearing pro-Kashmir freedom messages during the Champions Trophy clash in Edgbaston, England. Pakistan's intelligence agency has instructed its agents to display these slogans: 'Kashmir Seeks Attention', 'Kashmir is bleeding', 'We stand with Kashmir', and 'Free the state of Jammu and Kashmir now'.

3141,"3,075 grooms got married in Bihar at gunpoint in 2016","May 25 was meant to be a memorable day for Julie, a 19-year-old girl in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district, 70 km north of the state capital Patna. A beautician had visited her for makeup and Julie was sparkling in her bridal attire.Her house was all decked up, the pandit (priest) was there to chant sacred mantra and Abhinay Kumar, a 22-year-old youth she was to tie the nuptial knot, was ready, though under duress. But, just when the marriage mantras were over, the police arrived; searching for the kidnapped groom after his parents registered a case to this effect. But as usual, the cops arrived late, and by the time the marriage was already over.They still wanted to rescue the groom but the bride and her family - backed with relatives and villagers - put up a tough fight, forcing the cops to beat a hasty retreat. The cops returned an hour later, angrier than before; and in greater number. They swung their batons with such ferocity that it left nearly two dozen men and women, including Julie injured.Now, a week later, with injuries all over her body, Julie is still struggling to walk straight. The Muzaffarpur senior superintendent of police Vivek Kumar has suspended Gayghat police station in-charge Rajesh Choudhary, holding him responsible for excesses. The only positive outcome for Julie in the entire drama was that her husband who was reluctant to marry her initially began to empathise, seeing her writhing in pain.""I have accepted her as my better half. Whatever difference there is between our families, it will get over shortly. Time will heal everything,"" he says.AROUND 3,075 KIDNAPPINGS FOR MARRIAGE IN 2016 Sounds like an unusual way to get married? In Julie and Abhinay's Bihar what is bizarre is not the manner in which the couple walked down the aisle, but the police action that followed. Surprisingly, this is nothing unusual in Bihar as the state witnesses around 3,000 couples getting hitched in the same style, almost every year. Statistics boils down to nine such marriages a day.Known as Pakadwa Vivah (marriage by abduction), the tradition is simple: zero-in on a prospective groom, kidnap him and make him tie the nuptial knot at gunpoint. And the numbers are in fact growing. Bihar witnessed 3,075 kidnapping for marriage in 2016. It was 3,001 in 2015 and 2,533 in 2014. And a majority of these marriages survive.Abduction for marriage appears to have remained unabated in 2017 too. According to figures available with the police, Bihar already has reported 830 kidnappings for marriage by March this year. On the other hand, only eight cases of kidnappings for ransom - which Bihar was once infamous for - have been registered during this period.Clearly, abduction for marriage is almost like an established, acceptable trend in Bihar. The NCRB Crime in India Report, 2015 report - which is the most recent official figure available at present - also confirms that while Bihar is far below other States when it comes to abduction of boys below 18 years of age, it stands at the top in the country when it comes to abductions of above 18-year-old males. In fact, the number of abducted males from Bihar in the 18 to 30 age-group category was 1,096 in 2015. The state alone accounted for nearly 17 per cent of the national figure in the category.""The abduction of boys for marriage is a direct consequence of social evils like dowry. It is a rearguard action from the bride's family, which finds itself under great material load while arranging the marriage. In a traditionally patriarchal society like Bihar, marriages have become a money-minting enterprise for the boy's parents. So, families without wherewithal to arrange a decent dowry resort to desperate measures like abducting a suitable bridegroom for their daughter's marriage,"" says Ashok Priyadarshi, a teacher in Nawada, a district infamous for such marriages.DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF SOCIAL EVILS LIKE DOWRYThough illegal, dowry is an inevitable traditional marriage practice by which the groom's family demands enormous sums of money and goods from the bride's family as a condition for letting their son marry her.Families resort to snatch men - often young boys- because it is easier than approaching boy's families and cheaper than paying the standard ""dowry,"" which is in lakhs plus a vehicle.Kamta Singh, Chairman of a Primary Agriculture Credit Society in Rampur, Navada claimed that almost 90 per cent marriages in the village have been solemnised by kidnapping a bridegroom. A good number of boys are kidnapped and married off during matriculation and intermediate examinations when they visit the examination centres. In March, a 17-year-old boy was kidnapped from Patna and married off to a 15-year-old girl shortly after he reached the city with a cousin who was appearing for matriculation examination. The boy, a class XII student, was whisked away by four men on two bikes after smothering him unconscious with a chloroformed cloth. By the time the boy regained his senses, he was inside a house with lots of people around, who told him that he was now married. His clothes too were changed into bridal attire.Families often use friends and relatives, and sometimes even hire professional criminals, to carryout abductions for marriages. In May 2009, criminals assigned to kidnap 16-year-old Lalbabu for marriage, opened fire in Gaya to terrorise a group of students, who were with the victim as he came out from a coaching Centre.Lalbabu's friend Praveen received a gunshot and succumbed to his injuries. A shocked Lalbabu was abducted by the criminals to a temple in Jehanabad district where he was forced to marry a 13-year-old girl Babita under the shadow of a gun. The marriage, however, fell apart with the police registering murder cases against the bride's father and brother.SECURITY PERSONNEL TOO GET KIDNAPPEDEven security personnel themselves can be kidnapped by the criminals. Once, the bodyguard of a Bihar Cadre IPS officer Shivdeep W Lande, now on deputation to Maharashtra, was kidnapped when he was posted in Jamalpur. But the kidnappers set him free after realising that they could invite a police backlash.Once a boy is kidnapped and taken to a bride's home, his future in-laws try to calm him down by placing a wedding headgear onto his head. The embroidered headgear, called a Mauri, is a symbol of his submissive acceptance. Many fight fiercely, but every kidnapped boy eventually relents under duress. In almost all such cases, the villagers extend support to the girl's family. The ceremony is videographed so that the tapes can be used as evidence later.In fact, even priests of village temples - where marriages are solemnised, like in the case of Lalbabu - cooperate with the girl's family and issue a certificate of marriage. Clearly, the approval from society to such marriages has emboldened the families to take the law into their hands.The practice has technically been illegal for years, but the law rarely has been enforced. Brutal as the custom is, it is widely perceived as practical.TALE OF THREE BROTHERS KIDNAPPED FOR MARRIAGE""Most people don't care it's illegal because there is a very high possibility of reconciliation. The boy's family frets and fumes after the marriage but only to raise a dowry demand. Assured that the boy is now theirs, the girl's parent are also willing to settle things by offering one-fourth of the usual dowry which they would have had to offer had the boy not been married,"" said Hetukar Jha a retired sociology professor at Patna University.Rajiv Narayan of Nawada in Bihar is one of the numerous such men who has put the past behind and accepted his wife, with whom he was forcefully married in 1976. Rajiv was tricked to visit Badhaiya in Lakhisarai district where he was married under duress when he was just 14.He was married to Madhuri Devi, who was only 12. Their families allowed the two to complete their studies before the two were formally made to live together. Today Rajiv is employed as a meter reader with Bihar Electricity Board while Madhuri is school teacher at Nawada.Rajiv's younger brother Ashok (40 year), a lawyer, was married at the age of 13 in a similar fashion with Annu of Pakribaswan village. The youngest brother Dhannjay was also abducted and married to Sunita of Bighawa village in 2002. Dhananjay, 25, now runs a Computer hardware shop."

3157,What is S-400 missile system that India will buy from Russia?,"On second day of his three-day stay in Russia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin and both the leaders agreed to strengthen ties between the two old allies. One of the highlights of Modi-Putin meeting in St Petersburg was the deal between the two nations for two additional nuclear power reactors in Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu. Apart from this, Russia also said that it was preparing to supply S-400 Triumf anti-aircraft missile systems to India, a move which would provide India a strategic edge over neighbouring countries Pakistan and China. Precontract preparations underway on the supplies of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile complexes to India, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin told reporters in St Petersburg.""It is difficult to say yet how much time they will take. There is an agreement between governments and now we are simply discussing the terms,"" Russia's official Tass News Agency quoted Rogozin as saying on the sidelines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ongoing visit to this Russian city.India and Russia had signed in October last year a deal worth over $5 billion on the Triumf air defence system. The defence deal also involved collaborating in making four state of art frigates besides setting up a joint production facility for making Kamov helicopters.The deals were announced following talks held between Modi and Russian president Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit held in Goa.ALL ABOUT S-400 MISSILE SYSTEM ALSO READ:Russia doesn't have tight military ties with Pakistan: Putin tells Modi Why the world is worried about this 'unstoppable' hypersonic Russian missile"
3158,Priyanka's Hollywood debut film Baywatch hits the theatres,"Director:  Seth Gordon Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka ChopraRating: (2.5/5)Baywatch, the TV series, is best remembered not for its great content, but for Pamela Anderson's jiggling jugs as she runs on the beach in slo-mo wearing her iconic red swimsuit. In Baywatch, the film, too, the female lifeguards have little to do other than pander to the male gaze. Ladies, worry not, there are enough shots of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Zac Efron's abs to keep you distracted from the lack of a solid plot.Dwayne plays Mitch Buchanon (originally played by David Hasselhoff), the leader of the lifeguard squad consisting of Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera), CJ (Kelly Rohrbach, stepping into Pamela Anderson's shoes), Summer (Alexandra Daddario), Matt Brody (Zac Efron) and Ron (Jon Bass). For Mitch, being a lifeguard is not just about getting a tan and occasionally saving people from drowning, but about ""saving the bay.""They get their opportunity when the Huntley Club gets a new owner, Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra), and things start going awry. Drugs and dead bodies start showing up on the beach, and the lifeguards are convinced that Victoria is somehow involved.The characters in Baywatch are largely unidimensional - Mitch is tough but emotional, the female lifeguards are mainly eye-candy and Matt is the stereotype of the cocky buff dude. Zac's Matt, the washed out Olympic gold medallist, almost gets some depth, but then the writers change their mind. One minute, he talks about his rough childhood spent in various foster homes, the next minute, he is back to being the thick-as-a-brick butt of jokes.Priyanka plays an alter ego of her Dil Dhadakne Do character in Baywatch - a girl who loses the family business to her brother, despite having the acumen, so she decides to come to the ""land of opportunity"" and rise to the top, by hook or by crook. She is convincing as the ruthless Victoria, but in terms of screen time, it feels like an extended cameo. Perhaps, some of the fault lies with the Indian Censor Board. Her ""Easy, Britney"" portion (from the trailer), for instance, is not in the final cut.Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron are as good as they can be in a film with a wafer-thin plot. Dwayne's deadpan delivery of a different emasculating insult directed at Zac's character every time (""One Direction,"" ""High School Musical,"" ""Bieber""...you get the gist) evokes some laughter. Jon Bass has his hilarious moments - when he sings Katy Perry's Roar in the shower and when he owns the dance floor.Baywatch, the film, has been remodelled as a comedy with far too many penis jokes, most of which are flaccid (pun intended). What does impress, however, is the cinematography. Visually, Baywatch looks great, with beautiful shots of the lifeguards diving into the crystalline water.David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson have somewhat confusing cameos just for the sake of it; they play the same characters as they did in the original. So Mitch 1 shares screen space with Mitch 2...you get it.If you're looking for a no-brainer with lots of eye-candy and low-intellect jokes, Baywatch makes for a decent one-time watch."

Last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) had red-flagged the proposal saying Raymonds promoters and their extended family are trying to buy the premium property in Mumbai from the company at throwaway rates which will result in loss of over Rs 650 crore to the company and its shareholders. ""...As a related party I am required to abstain from voting on this resolution. However, my personal opinion would be to vote against the resolution in interest of the shareholders and company,"" Raymond Chairman and Managing Director Gautam Hari Singhania said in a statement. ""Raymond is committed to protect shareholders interest..In the interest of all shareholders including minority shareholders, I would like to reinstate the fact that the company is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard the interests of stakeholders,"" he added. Following the IiAS warning last week, Raymond stock came under huge selling pressure, but later recovered. The company said IiAS report is based on incorrect and incomplete information, and not understood in correct manner. Raymond said the tripartite agreement was entered in 2007 between the company, lessor and occupants, all of whom were related parties, to offer apartments for sale at a substantial discount to the current prevailing market prices which would cause a major loss to the company and shareholders. ""Keeping this in mind, the company decided not to act on this agreement. As a result, three of the related parties to this agreement have initiated legal action against the company for implementation of this agreement,"" Singhania added. Singhania said the audit committee and board of directors took a considered view based on legal advice and in pursuance of best corporate governance practices and transparency, decided that the matter should be placed before shareholders after disclosing all relevant facts for considered decision making.

3161,Tesla fires female engineer who alleged sexual harassment,"A female engineer at Tesla who accused the car manufacturer of ignoring her complaints of sexual harassment and paying her less than her male counterparts has been fired in what her lawyer alleges was an act of retaliation.AJ Vandermeyden, who went public with her discrimination lawsuit against Elon Musk?s car company in an interview with the Guardian in February, was dismissed from the company this week.Vandermeyden had claimed she was taunted and catcalled by male employees and that Tesla failed to address her complaints about the harassment, unequal pay and discrimination. ?It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have,? she said at the time.In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired Vandermeyden, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee?s allegations with the help of a ?a neutral, third-party expert? and concluded her complaints were unmerited.?Despite repeatedly receiving special treatment at the expense of others, Ms Vandermeyden nonetheless chose to pursue a miscarriage of justice by suing Tesla and falsely attacking our company in the press,? a Tesla spokesperson said. ?After we carefully considered the facts on multiple occasions and were absolutely convinced that Ms Vandermeyden?s claims were illegitimate, we had no choice but to end her employment at Tesla.??This was absolutely shocking for AJ. She is devastated,? Therese Lawless, Vandermeyden?s attorney, said by phone. ?She brought the lawsuit in an attempt to make the workplace at Tesla more equitable and fair and to have Tesla comply with the law.?Asked about Tesla?s justification for the firing, Lawless said: ?They?ve just proven our case. It?s clear retaliation.? She added: ?Somebody is trying to instill in employees that when they speak out about matters they are legally allowed to speak out about, they too will be fired.? Vandermeyden?s firing is likely to reignite debate over employment standards in Silicon Valley, where startups and major tech corporations are grappling with complaints of systemic wage disparities, gender discrimination and sexual misconduct.An account of alleged sexism at Uber went viral earlier this year, fueling debate about harassment in the industry, while a recent federal lawsuit against Google has placed a spotlight on concerns about tech firms underpaying women.  Lawless, who represented the former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit, against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said she intended to file a formal retaliation complaint on behalf of Vandermeyden. ?It is illegal in the state of California for an employer to retaliate against an employee who asserts her rights, including her rights to receive equal pay as her male colleagues.?Vandermeyden, who started working at Tesla in 2013, claims in her lawsuit that she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over as a manufacturing engineer in the general assembly department.Her complaint further alleged that she raised issues about flaws in the quality testing of cars that her supervisors and male engineers had missed. Although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions over her, she alleged. The complaint said that she and other female engineers were denied promotions despite the fact that they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men.Vandermeyden also alleged that she experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?.Further, the lawsuit accused Tesla of retaliating against her for speaking up. Management allegedly told her that in order to advance her position, she would need to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was not expected of male engineers and was unattainable. Although she had positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department, according to the lawsuit, which also said that Tesla retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower?. Tesla has continued to strongly reject Vandermeyden?s claims. A spokesperson said the company had ?conducted a thorough internal investigation? and ?extensively re-reviewed all the facts?, repeatedly concluding that her allegations were false. Tesla added that Vandermeyden had been granted numerous positions ?over other more qualified candidates? and was ?given special treatment and opportunities for advancement that were unwarranted based on her qualifications?.?The termination was based on Ms Vandermeyden behaving in what the evidence indicates is a fundamentally false and misleading manner, not as a result of retaliation for the lawsuit,? the spokesperson added. ?It is impossible to trust anyone after they have behaved in such a manner and therefore continued employment is also impossible.?The Vandermeyden case is one of several labor issues that have dogged Tesla, which is facing growing scrutiny over its practices in California. Earlier this month, the Guardian published an investigation into working conditions at Tesla?s ?factory of the future? in Fremont, California, where several factory workers complained about their treatment at the plant.Incident reports revealed that ambulances have been called more than 100 times since 2014 for workers experiencing fainting spells, seizures, dizziness, abnormal breathing and chest pains. A recent report from a worker safety organization found that Tesla workers were injured at a rate 31% higher than the industry average in 2015.The company has said it has significantly improved safety standards in recent months at the factory, and Musk told the Guardian he cared deeply about the health and wellbeing of his employees. Vandermeyden, in her interview with the Guardian in February, emphasized that she believed Tesla was a ?revolutionary and innovative company? and said she took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the Model S car.?Until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she added. ?I?m an advocate of Tesla. I really do believe they are doing great things. That said, I can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.?At the time, Vandermeyden said she was hopeful her lawsuit and public comments would not end her career at the company. But she expressed some concern that her decision to speak out could result in retaliation. ?Half the time when I walk into work,? she said, ?I wonder if my badge is going to work.?Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"

3163,Cows sold online after ban on sale of cattle for slaughter,"Hamstrung by the government's restrictions on sale of cattle, farmers and livestock traders have found greener pastures in digital India. So, a swift search on online marketplaces such as OLX shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.The environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. The rule came as part of a tough new law against animal cruelty, but critics say they are aimed at placating hardline Hindu supporters of the Narendra Modi government. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday suspended the order for four weeks.Ravi Sharma from Uttar Pradesh's holy city Varanasi, which Prime Minister Modi represents in Parliament, seemed a little wary when spoken to about his online post selling a desi brown cow for Rs 75,000. He first wanted to know what this correspondent intended to do with it and what community she belonged to, categorically stating that he has no interest in selling to a certain minority group.Not far away from Varanasi, in Ghazipur, Bheem Singh is keen to get rid of three cows at the earliest. So much so that he is open to a distress sale for as much as 50 per cent less than the market price for cows. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows any more. Anyone can come and beat us,"" he said while pushing this correspondent to close the deal over the phone.The past two years have seen a rise in vigilante attacks on Muslims and lower caste Hindus involved in the cattle trade, leading to several deaths. A group of alleged ""cow protectors"" thrashed two meat traders on the suspicion that they were carrying beef on May 26. Police in Rajasthan's Bhilwara arrested five people, including an alleged member of the RSS - the BJP's ideological mentor - who torched a truck last week that they thought was carrying cows for slaughter.Several state governments have appealed to the PM to repeal the order, which they say was issued without consultations with them. Some have decided to drag the Centre to court. Environment minister Harsh Vardhan had said that cattle bought and sold directly from farms would not be affected by the government's order. ""The aim of the rules is only to regulate the animal market and sale of cattle in them and ensure (the) welfare of cattle"" in the markets,"" he had said. But many commentators see the move as a blow to beef and leather exports that will leave hundreds of thousands jobless and deprive millions of Christians, Muslims and poor Hindus of a cheap source of protein.It's not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. They have been available occasionally under the pets section. But there has been a sudden surge since the BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh in March with priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath taking the chief minister's post, and the rise of the gau rakshaks, or cow vigilantes."
3164,Model claims Hyundai fired her for being on her period,"If you think the concept of period-shaming isn't as rampant as it was a few years ago, then please allow us to help you snap out of your oblivious bubble.Model Rachel Rickert, 27, has decided to sue automobile giant, Hyundai, for ""shaming"" and firing her for being on her period. What may sound pretty illogical at first, turns into something even more confounding as it progresses. According to Rachel's version, she was not allowed to take a washroom break--and thus, change her tampon--while representing Hyundai at an international auto show for three hours straight.

As per her federal discrimination complaint filed at the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Rachel mentioned that she received a call by Seifred on April 15 informing her about being fired by Hyundai because they ""heard about Ms Rickert having her menstrual cycle and they didn't want Ms Rickert representing the company anymore,"" New York Post reports.

Sources in the Army told India Today that the firing was done in retaliation to Pakistan's constant violation of ceasefire along the Line of Control. INDIA'S DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER SUMMONED  Meanwhile, Pakistan summoned India's Deputy High Commissioner JP Singh in Islamabad following Army's killing. Pakistan alleges that at least one civilian was killed and four others were injured in the Indian firing in Battal sector this morning. Senior Pakistan official Dr Mohammad Faisal, who is a Director General (SA & SAARC), said, ""The deliberate targeting of civilians is indeed condemnable and contrary to human dignity and international human rights and humanitarian laws.""PAKISTAN'S PROVOCATION Earlier in the day, Pakistan Army initiated indiscriminate firing of small arms, automatics, 82 mm and 120 mm mortars from 0720 hours along the LoC in Naushera sector of Rajouri district and from 0740 hours in Krishna Ghati sector. Commenting on the ceasefire violation, Defence Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Manish Mehta said, ""The Pakistan Army initiated indiscriminate firing and shelling on our positions on the LoC in Rajouri district's Naushera sector and Krishna Ghati sector in Poonch.

3166,Parents have no right to dead kid's FB account: German court,"The parents of a dead 15-year-old who appealed to Facebook to allow them access to her account to see if she was being bullied before her death have lost their claim in court.Berlin?s court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that the parents of the teenager, who died in 2012 after falling in front of an underground train, had no claim to access her details or chat history. The ruling goes against the decision made in an initial judgment by the regional court in 2015. It raises fresh questions over digital inheritance and who has the right to manage someone?s online presence and intellectual property when they die.The court said it had made the ruling according to the telecommunications secrecy law which precludes heirs from viewing the communications of a deceased relative with a third party. Before the ruling both Facebook and the parents of the girl, whose identity has not been made public, reserved the right in the event of a defeat to take an appeal to Germany?s federal court of justice in Karlsruhe. The judge said they were free to do so, but the parents have not confirmed that this is what they still intend to do.The family have said they are desperate to find out whether the girl?s death in Berlin was suicide and, if so, whether it was the consequence of online bullying. They have said they want Facebook to allow access to chats she might have had online which might provide a clue as to the cause of their daughter?s unexpected death.The girl had reportedly given her mother the login details to her account when she was 14 but the company, having been informed of the girl?s death by one of her Facebook friends, froze or ?memorialised? her account. The move meant that photos and posts the girl had shared remained visible, and friends could pay tribute to her, but it was no longer possible to log in to the account. Facebook has refused to say who applied for the account to be frozen, also citing data protection. The person who lodged the request would have had to provide Facebook with proof that the girl had died. The US social media company has repeatedly rejected the parents? request, arguing that in the event messages from a user are revealed, other users would also be exposed. They argue that the conversations would have taken place on the understanding that their content remained private.In its 2015 ruling, Berlin?s regional court ruled in favour of the mother, arguing that the contents of the daughter?s Facebook account should be owned by her heirs. The judge insisted then that Facebook chats should be regarded no differently to the girl?s letters and diaries which her parents automatically inherited. Facebook appealed against that ruling, which is why the case was heard by the court of appeal. The ruling on Wednesday was based on weighing up inheritance laws drawn up almost 120 years ago and the rights of parents towards minors, with the telecommunications secrecy law introduced to protect the privacy of telephone conversations which was updated by the constitutional court in 2009 to include emails. Bj rn Retzlaff, the judge who ruled in Berlin, deemed that the same rules applied to internet chats. ?That is at the centre of our decision,? Retzlaff told the court, stressing at the same time that the decision had been a difficult one.In a statement in German to the media Facebook said it welcomed the ruling, adding: ?At the same time we are sympathetic towards the family and respect their wish. We are making every effort to find a solution which helps the family at the same time as protecting the privacy of third parties who are also affected by this.?The case recalls that of an Italian architect who appealed to Apple?s chief executive, Tim Cook, last year to unblock his dead 13-year-old son?s iPhone so he could download the photographs stored on it.

3167,Pak's ISI behind Kabul blast which killed 90: Afghanistan,"Afghanistan has blamed Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the banned terror group - the Haqqani network - for Wednesday's deadly bomb blast in Kabul's diplomatic area which killed at least 90 people and injured 300 others.Talking exclusively to India Today, Afghanistan Interior Ministry spokesperson Sediq Siddiqui said role of Pakistan's ISI has been established in Kabul explosion. ""We have nailed Pakistan's ISI role (in Kabul blast). Afghanistan expects Pakistan to crack down on Haqqani network. The attack will surely impact ties between the two (Afghanistan, Pakistan) countries,"" Siddiqui told India Today. He added that Kabul expects Islamabad to act against the  Haqqani network while expressing fears of more such attacks in the country.India and Pakistan both are victims of Pakistan sponsored terror, Siddiqui added. The Haqqani Network is an Afghan insurgent terror outfit based in Pakistan's Waziristan and has carried out many high-profile attacks on US forces, high ranking Afghan officials and foreigners in Afghanistan. The network has ties with Taliban and Al Qaeda and the US considers it a major threat to Afghanistan's stability.KABUL ATTACK Kabul's high-security diplomatic zone was rocked by a powerful blast on Wednesday morning. The explosion occurred near the German embassy at one of the entrances to Kabul's unofficial Green Zone.While the sewage tanker carrying the bomb was stopped from entering the zone, it was unclear how such a large quantity of explosives could get through the ring of checkpoints set up around Kabul to protect the capital.A huge crater ripped into the ground at the site of the blast and shattered windows in houses more than a kilometre away were testament to the power of the explosion, which was set off by a bomb concealed in the tanker.In scale, it was one of the worst such attacks since the US-led campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001 but in kind, it was only the latest in a grim series that has killed thousands of civilians over the years.(With inputs from Reuters) ALSO READ:Kabul bomb blast death toll hits 80, over 350 others injured in suicide attack near Indian embassy"
3168,"Bihar class 12 topper missing after results, scam suspected","The results of the class 12 Bihar Board has once again stirred controversy as Humanities topper Ganesh Kumar is untraceable since the examination results were declared on Tuesday.A resident of Saraiya, Giridih in Jharkhand, Ganesh Kumar was a student of Ram Nandan Singh Jagdeep Narayan college in Samastipur, 250 kms from Giridih. Kumar went underground soon after the results were declared, triggering suspicion over him securing the top spot in the Bihar Board examination.India Today, on Wednesday, reached Samastipur and while investigating, managed to get the admission form of Ganesh, which he had submitted in the college while taking admission in 2015. A look at the admission forms raises several questions regarding Ganesh Kumar: ""I am surprised that he has topped the Arts stream of the Bihar Board,"" said Jawahar Prasad, founder secretary of the college.India Today is also in possession of the intermediate marksheet of Ganesh Kumar, which is also raising questions. He secured 65 out of 70 in music (practical) and 18 out of 30 in theory. He also secured 92 marks out of 100 in Hindi.When India Today contacted Ganesh's family in Giridih, her sister Mukta said that he had left home almost four years back and did not go home all these years.""He left home four years back and during this time he never came to Giridih,"" said Mukta.It is notable that India Today, last year, unearthed the toppers scam and exposed how students became fake toppers after shelling out huge amount of money. This year, the Bihar School Examination Board claimed to have conducted the examination in a strict manner. This lead to the result with 64 per cent students having failed the examination.

3169,How has India's performance been in ICC Champions Trophy?,"India have had pretty mixed fortunes at the ICC Champions Trophy. India have played the tournament in all the previous seven editions finishing on top twice while ending runners-up once.Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and most lately Shikhar Dhawan have been key to India's rise at the multi-nation tournament. Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Ishant Sharma have been the among the top wicket-takers at the event while MS Dhoni is the most successful Indian wicket-keeper. This time they will go into the tournament as defending champions and would look to create history by becoming the first team to win the championship thrice.Here's a look at India's journey at the top ICC event:1998 Wills International Cups (Bangladesh) - SEMI-FINALSIndia fielded a strong side with Mohammad Azharuddin as captain. The side boasted of a strong batting line-up with the likes of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ajay Jadeja and Robin Singh in the side. Javagal Srinath spearheading the pace attack while Anil Kumble looked after the spin department.However,India were knocked out in semi-finals by West Indies, who were led by Brian Lara.2000 ICC KnockOut (Kenya) - RUNNERS-UPSourav Ganguly's 117 went in vain in the big final as Chris Cairns' 102 not out guided New Zealand to a four-wicket win to hand Kiwis the trophy. Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan made their debuts for India in the tournament.2002 ICC Champions Tropy (Sri Lanka) - CHAMPIONS (Shared)India, under Sourav Ganguly, went a step further by becoming the joint champions with Sri Lanka after the final was rained-off twice. In the final, Sri Lanka posted 244/5 with Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara scoring a fifty each. In reply, India started off well and were 14/0 in two overs when rain halted the proceedings and no further play was possible that day.On the reserve day, Sri Lanka again won the toss and batted first. This time Mahela Jayawardene and Russell Arnold struck fifties to help Sri Lanka post 222/7 in their 50 overs. In response, Virender Sehwag looked at his menacing best with 25 not out off 22 balls when heavy rain stopped play. Once again the persistent rain denied a result and the trophy was awarded to both Sri Lanka and India.2004 ICC Champions Trophy (England) - GROUP STAGEIndia failed to go beyond the group stage. India started off their campaign with a thunderous 98-run win over Kenya but a three-wicket defeat against Pakistan was enough to stop Ganguly's men from advancing to the semi-finals.2006 ICC Champions Trophy (India) - GROUP STAGEIndia's batting line-up failed to fire in the big tournament at home. They managed to beat England in their first game but their star-studded batting continued to misfire and consecutive defeats against West Indies and Australia left them with just one win in the tournament.2009 ICC Champions Trophy (South Africa) - GROUP STAGEIndia again failed to impress. Rahul Dravid-led side started with a 54-run loss against Pakistan while their next game against Australia yielded no result because of rain. In their third group match, India beat West Indies to finish with three points in the table but it was not enough to get them through to the semi-finals."

3171,"Shane Warne sledged me for 10 years, says Sourav Ganguly","The Aaj Tak Salaam Cricket 2017 brought together some of the most iconic names in the cricketing world and there were some expected fireworks right through the day, especially when the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Shane Warne came face-to-face with Michael Clarke watching on.Ganguly had, in 2001, tamed Australia in that historic series which the hosts won 2-1 after bouncing back from a defeat at the Wankhede Stadium. It was in the course of that iconic series that the then Indian captain Ganguly, had got to the Australians' nerves by delaying the toss.Sixteen years later, Shane Warne, who was an integral part of Steve Waugh's team, said he was okay with what Ganguly did in his home turf and thought it was a smart, aggressive move to derail the Aussies by coming out late for the toss.However, Ganguly, who was present along with Clarke for the session titled ""Warnie, Pup and Dada"" show, reiterated that Warne wasn't as accepting of the tactic back in 2001: ""Everytime I came out to bat , he would pitch the ball outside leg and remind me to play the game in the right spirit.""Known for their wit and humour, both Ganguly and Warne kept 'sledging' each other as the audience burst into laughter. However, their mutual respect was palpable.""I have seen Warne sledge me throughout. We were playing for different counties and he would see me come out and he would sledge me. Even when it was Rajasthan Royals vs Kolkata Knight Riders, he would come at the toss and start sledging me from there itself. And all this happened for a period of 10 years. But he's a fabulous bowler and the best I have faced. I have played against Muttiah Muralitharan too and I'm lucky to get some runs against both of them,"" Ganguly said.Warne said he got sledged by Ganguly in equal measure.: ""Sourav never said a word back - can you believe that ?""But Warne showed his admiration for Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Virender Sehwag - known as the Fab 5 of Indian cricket and said their contributions towards Indian cricket was immense.  ""Don't ever underestimate how good these guys are - I would much rather bowl to the modern day Indian guys than these guys. India became one of the best sides in the world under Sourav,"" Warne said.Warne said sledging Ganguly made the legendary Indian batsman more determined than ever: ""I sledged him thinking I could get him out this time but that only made him more determined. It was under Sourav that India because one of the best sides from one of the better sides because he gave them the toughness, the feeling of not going under any team.""Clarke, who had captained Australia with great success after Ricky Ponting stepped aside, said he was lucky to play the game alongside legends such as Warne and Ganguly.""The players I idolised I got to play with and against - it's a great example of why you play the game. They were so competitive on the field. That's why the game is so special."

3173,Peacock is national bird as it doesn't have sex: HC judge,"Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma of Rajasthan High Court has set social media on fire saying peacock is India's national bird because the bird does not have sex to reproduce. Justice Sharma said that the peahen gets pregnant drinking the tears of the peacock.  We know cow is a holy animal in India. Slaughtering cows hurt religious sentiments of many Hindus. Cows have also become an excuse for extreme Hindutva organisations to thrash Muslims mercilessly, and to even kill them in the name of 'gau raksha'.Tiger is the national animal of India. But as cow is becoming the single most important source of controversies in the nation, of course other than assault on women, many people feel cow should be India's national animal. The Rajasthan High Court judge Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma thinks so too. This morning, the Rajasthan High Court recommended life imprisonment for cow slaughter. Justice Sharma also urged the Centre to declare cow India's national animal. Keeping in mind Articles 48 and 51A(g) of the Constitution and to provide legal entity for their proper protection and conservation of cow, it is expected from the government that cow is declared a national animal,"" Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma said in his 145-page order after hearing the Hingonia Gaushala case. It was Justice Sharma's last day at work today.   Interacting with the media post giving the verdict, Justice Sharma said, ""Peacock is a bramhachari and it does not have sex with a female peacock. The peahen gets pregnant drinking the tears of the peacock. Even lord Krishna carried the feather of a peacock on his head.""HOW DO PEACOCKS MATE? Peacocks mate how other birds mate. Female peacocks do not impregnate themselves by gulping down make peacock's tears. That happens only in mythology. Male peacock usually spread its tail feathers, strut about shaking the feathers and attract the attention of the female peacock. The female peacocks, often picky, mates with the male peacock who has the largest and most colourful feathers. Male peacocks even dances before the female peacock to impress and to get an indication of consent unlike many human beings. Once female peacock consents, the male peacocks jumps on the female peacock's back, align its sexual organ known as cloacas and have intercourse.Here's a video to prove peacocks do not swallow tear drops to satisfy their bodily needs: Unlike human beings, peacocks are polygamous and are open about it. Male peacocks often part ways with the female peacocks after mating, and in search of new mates. The female peacocks do not expect male peacocks to help it to raise the young ones either.HOW DO MYTHOLOGICAL PEACOCKS MATE? As per Hindu mythology, Lord Krishna is adorned with peacock feather as a sign of purity. Peacock feather is considered pure because the myth has it that peacocks and peahens do not mate to reproduce, but that the peahen gets impregnated by swallowing peacock's tears.    INTERNET TRUMPS JUSTICE SHARMASince internet is internet, it doesn't disappoint. There have been many discussions on Quora about the piousness of peacock even before Justice Sharma triggered a conversation about how peacocks mate, and people have been sensible enough to understand that impregnation through the intake of tear drops is nothing but a myth.

3175,Nothing unconstitutional in cow slaughter ban: Kerala HC,"A day after the Madras High Court ordered a month-long stay on the Centre's ban on cattle sale for slaughter, the Kerala High Court today said there is no need for it to interfere with the new rules as it doesn't violate the Constitution.Kerala High Court Chief Justice Navniti Prasad said this while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought quashing of notification on ban on cattle sale for slaughter.The court said there is no constitutional violation in the order issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change which has created an uproar in some states including Kerala.The Kerala High Court observed that there was nothing in the new central law on cattle trade and slaughter that takes away the rights of people with regard to eating beef.""If anyone reads it properly, the present law prevailing in the country along with the new order that came out none will not have come to this sort of conclusion. There is no ban on slaughter or sale of beef.

It has also been criticised that the order imposes an indirect ban on beef.The notification had created an uproar in many states including protests by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.In Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, a group of students conducted a beef festival, showing their agitation against the Centre's order.Against this backdrop, union minister Venkaiah Naidu has said the Centre is examining the issues. It was also reported earlier that the government may exempt buffalo from the list.THE NEW RULESThe Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had last week notified new rules under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, which bans sale of cattle for slaughter in open markets across the country.A gazette notification, titled Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 by the ministry had stated that no one can bring cattle to an animal market unless he or she has furnished a written declaration that the cattle will not be sold for the purpose of slaughter.Further, upon sale of cattle, the animal market committee will take an ""undertaking"" that the animals are for agricultural purposes and not for slaughter.Also read:"

3179,First wind farm powered by giant kites to be built in UK,"London, May 29 (PTI) Scientists are building the worlds first wind farm powered by giant kites in Britain that could generate enough electricity to run 5,500 homes. As many as twenty kites flying higher than Britains tallest building will work in pairs to generate electricity. They will fly in loops at more than 160 kilometres per hour. Their movement will pull on a tether wrapped around a rotating drum on the ground linked to a generator. The kites take turns to fly out and back, ensuring that the power supply is constant. Scotland-based company Kite Power Systems (KPS) has successfully tested a 40 kilowatt version. The company plans to build ten 500kW systems about 600 metres apart at a site by the year 2020. ""The kite farm would preferably be in Scotland and would generate enough power for 5,500 homes,"" said David Ainsworth, KPSs business development director. The kites are much cheaper than wind turbines as they use a lot less steel and are easier to transport and maintain, Ainsworth told The Times. "

3182,Virat Kohli described Anil Kumble as 'intimidating': Reports,"Team India cricketers are apparently not very happy with Anil Kumble and they have complained to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) about the coach's overbearing attitude. Sources told India Today that the players are unhappy with the fact that there was no freedom in the dressing room and insisted that the coach does enjoy cordial relations with the players. It appears Kumble does not enjoy the confidence of his players.WATCH FULL VIDEOThis is a startling development ahead of India's Champions Trophy defense which commences on June 4 at Edgbaston with clash against arch-rivals Pakistan.Kumble was appointed coach for a one-year term by the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) comprising his former teammates Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman in 2016.The former leg-spinner took over and oversaw five successive series triumphs besides limited-overs series victories over New Zealand and England.Under Kumble's watch, India were nearly unbeatable in the home Test season - losing only one of 13, winning 10 and drawing two. However, the BCCI initiated a hunt for a new coach and many felt it was because the board was unhappy with his role in salary negotiations for the players with the CoA.Since it is a volatile situation, the CoA is understood to play it carefully, especially as India are days away from the Champions Trophy.Back in 2007, Australian Greg Chappell's tenure as India coach had come to an end following a public spat with Ganguly and complaints from several other senior cricketers. In the decade that followed, the likes of Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh have spoken out about the tough times the team endured under Chappell.Unlike Chappell, however, Kumble, has delivered the results. Under his command, India have not lost any series and Chesteshwar Pujara, who was going through a slump midway into 2016, finished the last season as the most prolific of Test batsmen.The BCCI, in a press release issued on May 25, merely stated that a nominee of the CoA would oversee the process of appointing the next coach to ensure transparency."

Whenever there is a downturn, there is always noise about unions coming into play in the IT industry but it never sustained, ex-Chief Financial Officer of Infosys Ltd, V Balakrishnan told PTI. ""Work ethic is very good and salaries are high. Even today the attrition rate in the IT industry is double digit. It (talk of employees unions) always fizzles out after some point of time. It never sustained,"" he told PTI. ""But I think even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because IT industry is one of the best paymasters in the country and second, the people find opportunities outside"", he said. The employees unions work in industries where work ethic is bad and where employees are treated shabbily. Following reports of layoffs and fears about further retrenchment in the slow-down hit IT industry, there had been some talk in recent times about forming a union. ""IT industry is not bad, IT industry people are well taken care of, well-paid, and they find opportunities. Even one of the bad years, this year, where growth rate has come down, the attrition is still double digit. ""So, I dont find a need for union in this industry. Even if there is a union, I dont think it will impact the industry much because people are well taken care of in this industry,"" said the former Board member of Infosys. Balakrishnan said the reports about widespread job losses in IT industry are exaggerated. ""If you look at all the leading companies, none of them are talking about huge job losses; they are all talking about the regular performance-based attrition, that is normal in the industry. So, to some extent the scare of job losses is exaggerated,"" he said. He said IT is not a traditional industry. ""Its a global industry where you get global opportunities to work. This industry is different, its not like traditional industry. I dont know whether formal union kind of structure will succeed."" On if boom times are over for the Indian IT industry, Balakrishnan said: ""Thats what we had been told when 2000 dotcom happened...Y2K came up...2008 financial crisis. Same concerns were expressed then."" "
3185,Hizbul militant Bhat hid for 10 hrs during encounter: Report,"Sabzar Ahmad Bhat, the slain Hizbul commander who routinely released his photographs in combat gear for social media, was no braveheart. Details emerging about the terrorist's last moments point at his being more adept at shooting from a smartphone than the Kalashnikov on his shoulder.Senior Army sources, privy to the operation in which Bhat was cornered and neutralised in Tral area of Kashmir's Pulwama district last Saturday, told Mail Today that the 27-year-old terrorist remained in hiding for nearly 10 hours, without firing a single bullet at the troops.Bhat also frantically sent text messages from his handset to gather a crowd of stone-pelters at the encounter site to provide him cover, the sources said.HOW DID ARMY TRACK SABZARSecurity forces had tracked down Bhat's location using technical intelligence provided to the troops on ground by the Jammu and Kashmir police cells. These units have been successful in nailing a large number of terrorists in recent years.""The intelligence provided by the police confirmed that Sabzar and Faizan were in a cluster of houses in Saimoo village in Tral area and we laid a cordon on Friday evening around his house,"" senior Army sources said. The raiding party included Army, Special Operations Groups and state police troops.After laying the cordon, the troops tried to establish contact with Sabzar and his category A accomplice Faizan. There was no retaliation or firing from the terrorists in hiding as forces suspect the two did not want to give away their positions.A large number of weapons including an AK-47 and INSAS assault rifles along with a huge cache of ammunition and other warlike stores, were recovered from the hideout after the operation was over.After failing to establish contact with terrorists, the raiding team decided to ""smoke out the rats"" and called for fire tenders filled with petrol instead of water.STONE PELTERS TO RESCUE?Meanwhile, Bhat and his accomplice were trying to gather a crowd of stonepelters to be able to escape from the encounter location but the late hours did not get them much help. Sources said their messages betrayed desperation and fear.""Petrol was poured inside the first house using hose pipes and it was set on fire but the two did not react. The result in the second house was also the same. But when the troops poured in petrol in the third house around 8:15 am, the two ran out of the house and tried to breach the cordon,"" the sources said. Before Bhat could open fire, the troops fired a hail of bullets. Within a few seconds, the two ""propagandist terrorists"" were lying dead on the ground.Army sources said Sabzar, a Class 7 dropout, was a known womaniser and drug addict at the time of his joining the Hizbul Mujahidden two years back. He replaced Burhan Wani who had been killed last year by the Army in South Kashmir.Both the terrorists were tracked by technical intelligence sleuths and killed in similar brief encounters. Sources said in Burhan's case too, the terrorist was trapped when the technical cells of Jammu and Kashmir police had followed a terrorist named Sartaj and did not know about Burhan's presence there.However, in Sabzar's case, they were tracking him directly and were sure about his presence in the Tral area.Sources said the recent crop of local terrorists is high on propaganda and try to conjure up a hero-like status by spreading their pictures on social media in full combat gear. ""Little do they know that this act of theirs is of big help for security forces in identifying them and locating them,"" the sources said.As part of Pakistan's strategy, local terrorists, who are not even trained formally into firing and combat tactics, are being used as cannon fodder to keep the militancy in J&K alive.Also Read"

3192,Acid attack victims to be included in Disability Act,"The Centre is bringing in 14 new categories of physical and mental conditions, under the ambit of the Disability Act, 2016. Under the new notification, scheduled to be issued next month, acid attack survivors will be treated as disabled, a senior official in the social justice and empowerment ministry said.At present, the act provides the disability rights and benefits to seven special categories of people comprising blindness, low-vision, locomotive disability, hearing impairment, mental retardation, mental illness and leprosy.The new conditions will apply to people with cerebral palsy, dwarfism, muscular dystrophy, specific learning disabilities, deafness, autism, spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, haemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities (condition of any two disabilities or more) and acid attack survivors.PREVIOUS ACTSMinistry officials said the previous Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 1995 mentions only seven categories with people having 40per cent and above disability getting full benefits. In 2001, disability assessment guidelines were prepared for these categories, but there was no measure to calculate the percentage of disability in a person.""The ministry therefore formed a committee to review how to assess and measure the exiting as well as the proposed disability percentage in a person and accordingly entitlements would be given to the person,"" the official said.The proposed move has come in from all-round praise from social activists.BENEFITS FOR ACID ATTACK VICTIMSLauding the move, Shaheen Malik of Delhi Commission for Women said: ""Adding acid attack survivors into special categories is one of the best things that this government is doing.""Now, this will ensure if the disabled do not get a private job, he or she can get government entitlements. Also, after an acid attack, our studies get discontinued due to financial losses, so now we can opt for higher studies too,"" Malik said.As per 2011 census, India has 26,810,557 people under disabled population. Government officials said once the new disability assessment guidelines come, all district medical officers will be advised to follow new norms in issuing the certificate.A ministry official said, ""Classification of a person's disability is being made with the difference of 10 per cent each. The health ministry is soon going to submit its report to the social justice and empowerment ministry and it will be notified soon. Presently, people with 40per cent and above disability are getting full benefits. Till then, existing guidelines have to be followed.""""All district medical officers would be trained to calculate percentage of disability and understand the new guidelines. It has been noticed that people misuse their disability for benefits, even if they are not eligible. We are making it more clear and stringent so that people with serious disability (40per cent and above) do not get neglected,"" the official said. The committee which drew the new guidelines worked in collaboration with the Union health ministry on the lines of global norms. This committee also formed sub-committees with experts from AIIMS, NIMHANS, Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia.Also Read"

And the Udta Punjab actor, reportedly, isn't too pleased as he wants Ishaan to concentrate on his Bollywood debut. If reports are to be believed, Shahid doesn't want Ishaan's personal life to take away the focus from his debut film Beyond The Clouds. And that's the reason he has warned his brother to keep his private life discreet as these rumours can prove damaging for his career.Ishaan, who assisted Abhishek Chaubey in Udta Punjab, will make his big screen debut with a film on brother-sister relationship. Jhanvi, on the other hand, is busy prepping for her Bollywood debut. However, details of her big screen debut have been kept under the wraps.   "

3203,Pak hikes defence budget by 7% amid tensions with India,"Nawaz Sharif led Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government on Friday presented its fifth budget before the 2018 general elections alloting a total of Rs 4,757 billion expenditure for the next fiscal year. Stating that Pakistan's economy has grown to over USD 300 billion, finance minister Ishaq Dar presented the annual budget at the National Assembly, hiking the expenditure on defence by 7 per cent.Sharif-led government has allocated Rs 60 billion more to defence than what it allocated in the year 2016-17.""We have increased the defence budget to Pakistani Rs 920 billion (from Pakistani Rs 860 billion),"" Dar saidIn addition to that, Dar also announced a 10 per cent hike in the salaries of soldiers who contributed in defeating militants in Operation Zarb-e-Azb, launched in 2014. This is not the first time, that Pakistan's defence budget has been so high; in 2015-16 the budget was  Rs 775.8 billion and Rs 860 billion in in 2016-17. According to financial experts, the increase in thedefence budget comes in the light of cross border tensions with India, Afghanistan and Iran.Experts also say that though Pakistan Army has been rooting out terrorism from its own soil, through military operations Zarb-e-Azb, Khyber-I, Khyber-II and now Rad-ul-Fasad, tensions between India and Pakistan have only increased. India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants, who infiltrate from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into the Valley and target Indian security forces. One such attack in September last year killed 18 Indian soldiers and India retaliated with ""surgical strikes"" on terrorist launchpads in PoK. Most recently, the Pakistan Army sentenced Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav on charges of espionage after a secret trial. India had demanded consular access to Jadhav, which Pakistan repeatedly denied, claiming the man was an Indian spy. India and Pakistan are also at loggerheads over a China- backed economic corridor that runs through PoK. China says it is a developmental project and will aid Pakistan's economy.

3204,Need 'innovative ways' to fight 'dirty war': Army Chief,"Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat today defended his troops over the human shield controversy saying that his men needed innovative ways to fight the ""dirty war"" in Kashmir.Rawat told PTI that when people were throwing stones and petrol bombs at Army personnel, he cannot tell his men to 'just wait and die'. ""This is a proxy war and proxy war is a dirty war. It is played in a dirty way. The rules of engagements are there when the adversary comes face-to-face and fights with you. It is a dirty war.... That is where innovation comes in. You fight a dirty war with innovations,"" Rawat told PTI.""People are throwing stones at us, people are throwing petrol bombs at us. If my men ask me what do we do, should I say, just wait and die? I will come with a nice coffin with a national flag and I will send your bodies home with honour. Is it what I am supposed to tell them as chief? I have to maintain the morale of my troops who are operating there,"" Gen Rawat said.Rawat went on to indicate that stone pelters had complicated the security situation in Kashmir, saying his force would find it easier to quell protests if instead of stones, weapons were used.  ""In fact, I wish these people, instead of throwing stones at us, were firing weapons at us. Then I would have been happy. Then I could do what I (want to do),"" Rawat told PTI.Saying that the Army cannot run away from its role to provide security, Rawat said, ""Tomorrow elections have to be held in Anantnag and similar things may happen. If the army does not respond to call for assistance, then the trust between the people whom we are protecting, police and army will break."" ""That is something I cannot allow to happen. This is what the militants want. It can create a divide between the army and other security forces,"" he said.'NEED TO FEAR THE ARMY'He added that the Indian Army is a friendly force and is practising maximum restraint to deal with the Kashmir situation. Rawat noted that the force can only do its job if the country fears it. ""Adversaries must be afraid of you and at the same time your people must be afraid of you. We are a friendly army, but when we are called to restore law and order, people have to be afraid of us,"" he said.Rawat also spoke about the core issue of Kashmir, saying that it is something that needs a composite solution and is a process in which everybody will have to get involved. ""It will have to be a composite solution. Everybody will have to get involved. Army's role is to ensure that violence does not take place and the common man who is not indulging in this (violence) is protected,"" he said, when asked about the solution to the Kashmir issue.HUMAN SHIELD CONTROVERSY The Army chief's statements come days after Major Leetul Gogoi of the 53 Rashtriya Rifles was awarded a Commendation Card by General Rawat for the former's role in countering insurgency in Kashmir.In his PTI interview, Rawat said that Gogoi's commendation was awarded with the aim of boosting the morale of his troops. ""As Army Chief my concern is morale of the Army. That is my job. I am far away from the battle field. I cannot influence the situation there. I can only tell the boys that I am with you. I always tell my people, things will go wrong, but if things have gone wrong and you did not have malafide intent, I am there,"" he said.Major Gogoi is the same officer who sparked nationwide controversy after tying a Kashmiri local to an Army jeep. Gogoi, in a statement delivered recently, said his actions were aimed at saving the lives of the men under his command as well as those of stone pelters in Kashmir. On April 9, the day of polling for the Srinagar Parliamentary bypoll, Major Gogoi and his team were called to the Utligam polling both to rescue civilian and security personnel trapped at the location. Major Gogoi said that around 1,200 protesters had surrounded the booth and in order to escape from the booth, with the people he had just rescued, he grabbed a person he believed to be the ring leader of the protesters and got him tied to a jeep. The man - Farooq Ahmad Dar - has denied that he was a stone pelter. Gogoi and his team then drove the jeep with Dar tied to it out of the area. A video of the incident, shared by former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, went viral on social media and caused a huge controversy, forcing the Army to set up a Court of Inquiry into the incident. Sources previously told India Today that the CoI has not found Major Gogoi to be at fault. Gogoi continues to serve the Rashtriya Rifles unit.However, Rawat told PTI he has a general idea about what is going on in the Court of Inquiry and that is why he went ahead with awarding the Major. ""I know what is happening in the COI. It is being finalised. What do we punish him for.""UNREST IN KASHMIRRawat's comments come amid concerns of widespread unrest in the Kashmir Valley following Saturday's killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Sabzar Ahmad Bhat. Bhat, the successor of Burhan Wani, was killed on Saturday in an Indian Army operation. Wani's death had sparked months of violent unrest in Kashmir leading to the deaths of more than 100 civilians. Officials have however expressed confidence that a repeat of the post-Wani violence won't happen as the establishment is prepared to deal with stone pelters. "

Earlier, the same film was to star Pakistan actor Fawad Khan along with Katrina, but with the ban on Pakistani actors during Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, that is not happening. Hence the filmmaker was keen to rope in Salman. The script is being reworked for Dabangg Khan and to make the character more suitable to him.

3206,"Don't mind men flirting with me, it's a compliment: Sushant","Sushant Singh Rajput is currently on cloud number nine. He had a fantastic 2016 with his film MS Dhoni: The Untold Story earning more than Rs 100 crore at the Indian box office. Now he has a range of films lined up, in various stages of production, the latest being Raabta which stars Sushant's rumoured ladylove, Kriti Sanon.Given Sushant's good looks and his new-found success, it is understandable that women would like to hit on him these days. But it's not just the fairer sex who take an interest in Sushant. When Filmfare Magazine recently asked him about his thoughts on the attention he gets from his male fans, the actor was at his nonchalant best.So, do men hit on him and does he like it? ""Probably... but I don't get to know. Normally, you sense things that you expect. And that's not what I'm expecting. So I don't get it many times but there are times when I do understand. I don't mind it. It's a compliment,"" Sushant Singh Rajput said.Sushant Singh Rajput is rumoured to be dating Kriti Sanon though neither of them have officially confirmed or denied the buzz. Regardless of its truth, the dating rumours can only add to the pre-release noise around Raabta, for now, and that isn't harmful."

3210,Misconception that underworld invested money in B'wood: RGV,"Mumbai, May 27 (PTI) Filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma says contrary to the popular perception, underworld never invested money into Bollywood and there was never really a ""nexus"" between them. Varma says the activities of underworld with regard to Bollywood were mostly limited to making calls to either scare celebrities or help their friends. ""Its a misconception that theres a nexus between underworld and Bollywood. Underworld never put money, which again is a misconception. If underworld also has to put money, why is it underworld? It defeats the purpose,"" Varma told reporters last evening. ""Most of the times, either they use it for publicity, they used to get high in scaring who we think are our stars and big filmmakers. But the underworld at that time was in the mood of being in the news. They were very publicity crazy at that time."" The filmmaker was speaking at a special event where he unveiled the teaser of his upcoming web series ""Guns and Thighs"", which chronicles the rise and fall of the Mumbai underworld. ""By 2004, most of the gangsters were killed and they lost a lot of power. Disbanding the encounter squad was a signal that underworld as a force has been completely reduced."" The director, known for making several gangster-dramas like ""Satya"", ""Company"" and ""D"", says he has never been at the receiving end of the underworld because of his films. ""If I am still alive that means I am not at the receiving end. Why would the underworld have any problem with anyone making a film."" His web-series will have four seasons of ten episodes each in which Varma says he has ""pushed the envelope"" when it comes to the content as the digital medium offers freedom to tell stories the way one wants to. Asked whether it is hard not to glorify someone, especially when one is making a film on gangsters, Varma says, ""Gabbar Singh is the most loved character, but I dont know if a single person got inspired to become a dacoit in Chambal valley after seeing Sholay.

3216,Revenue share is 'starving' grassroots: Cricket Australia,"Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland believes the revenue-share model which the body is trying to dump in its ongoing pay negotiations with players is ""starving"" the grassroots of the game of funding.Australia faces the possibility of an embarrassing player strike or lockout if the protracted negotiation over a new five-year pay deal for country's international and state cricketers cannot be resolved by the end of June.At the heart of the dispute is the arrangement whereby the players share a fixed percentage of up to 26 percent of Cricket Australia's revenue, which Sutherland's executive team want to end.The players, through their union, have remained steadfastly opposed to such a change but Sutherland says it is essential if the grassroots of the game is to get the investment it needs.""The model was created in 1997, when players were poorly paid, but now our top male players are easily the most highly paid team sportspeople in Australia,"" he wrote in a column in The Weekend Australian on Saturday.""The main issue in 2017 is the chronic under-funding of grassroots. This will require an investment over time of many hundreds of millions of dollars and we must start now.""We believe we can achieve both a healthy increase in player payments and our grassroots funding objectives over the next few years by sensibly adapting the current player payments model.""With more than 80 percent of the country's 5,584 cricket facilities currently having no provision for women and girls, meeting the needs of female players was the sort of project desperately required, he added.Sutherland said that because the agreement was for revenue rather than profit share, any new investment Cricket Australia made would need to guarantee a 32 percent return just to break even, ""an untenable situation for any business"".""The current model of player payments has done its job, but now risks starving other vital parts of the game,"" he concluded.""That must change.""Cricket Australia has come under fire for not explaining its position clearly enough in what has been a tense standoff with the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA).The ACA on Saturday blasted Cricket Australia for ""lacking in common sense"" by refusing mediation to end the dispute and said the governing body's ""claims"" on the grassroots needed to be closely examined.""CA take 80 percent of revenue and yet blames the players for under expenditure on grassroots,"" it said on its website (www.auscricket.com.au)"

He asked me as to why I am carrying a knife. I told him that it is a kripaan - a holy sign of our religion - but he tried to pull me down,"" Singh narrated.However, as the media turned their cameras on me, he left me instructing a female cop to intercept me, he added.""The female cop asked me to take off my turban. Then an altercation took place after which I said whether you allow me to meet the CM or not, I will not take off my turban,"" Singh added.After all the ruckus, Singh was finally let in.

3220,Tonic water firm Founder earns ?602 crore on selling shares,"Fever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in  73m of shares.The sale left the company?s stock down 2% at  17.12 on Thursday ? but that is still nearly 13 times its  1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth  222m, and the company is valued at nearly  2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino?s Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain.That is astonishing for a business with sales of just  100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin. But it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since Rolls and co-founder Tim Warrillow launched it in 2005.From a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling  25m of stock between them when they floated the company on the AIM market in 2014. Rolls has cashed out to the tune of  100m, because he also sold a  12m tranche of shares last year.He owes not just his fortune but apparently his life to tonic water ? or at least to its key medicinal ingredient, quinine. He once contracted malaria during a trip to Africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company?s name, with saving his life.Though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as Sicilian lemonade and ginger ale.It has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass.Its ginger comes from Ivory Coast and Nigeria, its lemons from Sicily, and Warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.These are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or Michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of Fever-Tree in its mixer cabinet.Indeed, one of the company?s early customers was world-renowned chef Ferran Adri , who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant El Bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world?s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in 2011.Posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on.Gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the UK, Spain and US. And premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics.Fever-Tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to  34.3m on sales of  102m.This month, the company announced that its 2017 results would comfortably exceed City forecasts, indicating that the Fever-Tree star is still very much in the ascendancy.Rolls, a former management consultant who revived the Plymouth Gin brand, and Warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by Schweppes of the mixers market.Rolls had noticed that the world?s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic. ?There?s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn?t right,? he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion?s share of a G&T, at least if it is made right.This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.And with an extra  73m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&T of the day."

3239,Bowlers second-class citizens in white-ball cricket: Bond,"""Bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket,"" says former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond, who feels odds are stacked heavily against them in the limited-overs format.Writing for the International Cricket Council ahead of the upcoming Champions Trophy in England starting June 1, Bond said limited-overs cricket is ""a batsman's game"".""And it isn't merely the fast bowlers, who have their task cut out. The change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little bit, but only a little bit,"" he said.""...but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket,"" he added.Bond said it is this imbalance which has led to spinners using negative tactics.""The slow bowlers specifically are resorting to a more negative line of bowling, not because they want to but because they have to,"" he said.""In an era gone by, the pattern was to tee-off in the first 15 overs, build through the middle of the innings and then launch a final onslaught. That philosophy has now gone out the window,"" he explained.Bond said bowlers cannot do without variety in the current scenario where every alternate game ends up being a run feast.""The yorker is not just one of the most difficult balls to bowl, the margin for error is also extremely small. Therefore, it becomes vital to use that weapon judiciously.""You must have the ability to change the length? bowl the yorker, yes, but also use the bouncer, the slower ball, the length ball,"" he opined.""You dont bowl the full ball to certain batsmen, you dont bang it in to certain others. All of it is very much opposition, ground, conditions and batter-dependent. If you are off even marginally, the yorker is probably the easiest ball to hit for a four or a six. You have to weigh up risk against reward,"" he said.Bond said bowlers in modern cricket should mix it up to make it difficult for the batsman to settle down."

He said: ?I will be heading over to Greater Manchester police force headquarters after this press call to take part in the Cobra meeting alongside the police constable.

Elle HuntFor some it sounded muffled and far away, as though somewhere in the distance a big balloon had popped. For others the terror was all too immediately apparent.The lights had just come on and Ariana Grande had left the stage after concluding an elaborate three-hour, four-part entertainment extravaganza with an encore performance of her latest single, Dangerous Woman.At 10.30pm following a sold-out show in the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, thousands of fans began to gather up their belongings and filter slowly out of four exits.Then the bang.For the first milliseconds, minds did not immediately connect the sound with an explosion or a bomb.?It sounded like a big balloon popping, but it was kind of muffled, like it wasn?t in the stadium itself,? said a young Mancunian fan, identified as Sammy, in a video he recorded of his experience and posted on Periscope.?There were a few screams, then there was silence. Then the whole arena literally split like the Red Sea ? everyone was trampling over each other, sprinting to get to the nearest exit. It was like a scene out of a horror movie.?"

Our thoughts are with those 22 victims that we now know have died, the 59 people who have been injured and their loved ones. We continue to do all we can to support them. They are being treated at eight hospitals across Greater Manchester.This is a fast-moving investigation and we have significant resources deployed to both the investigation and the visible patrols that people will see across Greater Manchester as they wake up to news of the events last night. This will include armed officers as people would expect. More than 400 officers have been involved in the operation during the night.To remind you, we were called at 10.33pm to reports of an explosion at the Manchester Arena at the conclusion of an Ariana Grande concert. More than 250 calls came in and emergency services were very quickly on scene. Emergency numbers have been established for anyone who is concerned for loved ones who may not have returned home: 0161 856 9400 or 0161 856 9900.We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe that while the attack last night was conducted by one man.

3253,Hunter dies after elephant he was hunting falls on him,"There is an idiom that elders often throw around: Pick on someone your own size. The keyword here is 'size'.A professional South African hunter in Zimbabwe, who specialised in 'big game' hunting, ended up being crushed to death under an elephant that had been shot.Theunis Botha, 51, was hunting at the Hwange National Park with his group, when he crossed paths with a herd of pregnant elephants. The elephants did not quite like this sudden meet-up with gun-carrying humans, and so, came charging at the hunters.In retaliation, Botha started firing at the charging animals. What he did not see, however, is that one elephant was coming towards him from the side. Before Botha knew it, he was up in the air by this elephant's trunk.Seeing this, one of the other hunters shot the elephant swinging Botha by its trunk, but they probably did not see how this could end. The wounded elephant released Botha, dropped him to the ground, and then collapsed right on top of him.Needless to say, Botha did not survive the crush. "

3255,India's population has overtaken China's: Chinese demographer,"China's population may be smaller than the official 1.37 billion figure and closer to around 1.29 billion people - less than India's population - according to an independent Chinese demographer.""China's real population may have been about 1.29 billion last year, 90 million fewer people than the official figure released by the National Bureau of Statistics,"" the South China Morning Post quoted Yi Fuxian, a scholar and demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as saying at a seminar in Peking University on Monday.Yi, who has been a critic of the Chinese government's family planning measures and warned of an upcoming ageing crisis for China, said that the government had overstated China's population since 1990. He suggested the ageing crisis may be more severe than expected.According to his numbers, India, with more than 1.3 billion people, is now the world's most populous country, overtaking China five years ahead of forecasts.Yi said ""there were 377.6 million new births from 1991 to 2016, less than the official figure of 464.8 million,"" the SCMP reported, noting that China's official figure was 1.37 billion.Despite the population burdens faced by both countries, this landmark is being seen by most Chinese scholars as a warning rather than any cause for relief, with fears of a rapidly declining workforce and concerns of supporting the world's largest above 60 population.Yi is far from alone in claiming China's official population data is overstated. ""The government has overestimated the birth rate and underestimated the speed of demographic changes,"" Li Jianxin, another demographer who is at Peking University, was quoted as saying by SCMP. Another scholar, Liang Zhongtang of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, also said official data wasn't accurate.""The population data since the adaption of one-child policy has been seriously false and the family planning report has been overstated by 30 per cent,"" Liang was quoted as saying. ""The birth control policy which has last nearly four decades is not in accordance with reality. It is imperative that the government should abandon the family planning system."""
3256,Russian helicopters' 'Make in India' cost 250% of original,"The price of Kamov light-utility choppers to be built in India is coming out to be almost 2.5 times the cost of the 60 such helicopters that would be built in Russia and supplied to the Indian Army and Air Force, for operations in high altitude areas such as Siachen and Ladakh.The issue over price and transfer of technology are slowing the deal which the armed forces require urgently to be completed to replace their vintage fleet of Cheetah and Chetak choppers for critical operations.Under a Indo-Russian governmental agreement, India is buying 200 Kamov 226 T helicopters of which 60 would be built in Russia and supplied directly to the forces while the remaining 140 would be manufactured in a joint venture between Kamov and HAL along with a private sector partner.""During negotiations with the Russian side, it has come out that the cost of the 140 choppers to be built in India would be around 2.5 times the cost of the first 60 helicopters. There are certain issues over this in the acquisition wing,"" Defence sources told MAIL TODAY.The progress of the deal may come up for discussion during the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow planned early next month.However, senior ministry officials said Make in India comes at a heavy cost as investments have to be made to create a new facility and manpower has to be trained along with acquisition of land for the new set up.The government had selected HAL as a partner but later on it also thought of including a private sector partner for the joint venture company to promote private participation in defence but this is going to add further cost to the programme, the sources said.H.A.L YET TO TAKE FINAL CALLThe decision on selecting the private sector partner has to be taken by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the company is yet to take a final call on the issue.The deal is also getting affected by the issue over the weight of the choppers, as it is believed that the ones built in Russia weigh more than what was specified in the tender requirements by the force.""The issue has been raised with the Russians and it is expected that some solutions would be found for reducing the weight soon,"" a source said.Sources said there seemed to be a minor issue over the interpretation of the clauses on the transfer of technology for the Kamov choppers as during one of the meetings, the Russians proposed to supply the 140 choppers to built in India as complete knocked-down and semi-knocked down kits -which would mean that the choppers would only be assembled and not built in India.TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY""We are very clear that we want transfer of technology for these choppers so that they can be built in future by our firms on their own in the future,"" a defence official said.Price has been a critical issue in defence deals involving Russia as several deals such as the under-development Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft and Multirole Transport Aircraft projects have been stuck because of the sudden and exorbitant cost hikes by Moscow.The biggest example of India suffering due to price hike was the INS Vikramaditya aircraft carrier project, which was to cost $900 million (over Rs 5,000 crore)at the time of signing in 2004, but was delivered in 2014 after an additional cost of $1.2 billion (over Rs 7,000 crore) in 2014.ALSO READ | Indian Army may acquire 39 American Apache choppers to enhance fire power at Pakistan, China borders"

3258,A person displaced every second by crises in 2016: Report,"Conflict, violence and natural disasters forced more than 31 million people to leave home and settle elsewhere within their countries last year, the equivalent of one person every second.But while the number of people uprooted by conflict outnumbers refugees by two to one, they have been largely ignored by the international community, according to a report by the Norwegian Refugee Council?s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. Alexandra Bilak, director of the IDMC, said that while resources had rightly been devoted to the refugee crisis, scant attention had been paid to people forced to resettle. ?Not including internal displacement as an integral part of that entire displacement and migration picture is very shortsighted, because by looking only at the point of arrival and not considering where those journeys started, inevitably you?re missing part of the picture,? she said. ?If you redirect attention to the countries of origin and to really understanding the driving forces of these movements it would be a much more strategic approach and investment,? added Bilak.Last year, an estimated 6.9 million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of conflict and violence. Worst affected was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 922,000 were displaced, a 50% rise on the previous year. Close behind was Syria (824,000), followed by Iraq (659,000), Afghanistan (653,000), Nigeria (501,000) and Yemen (478,000).Disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires had an even greater effect, displacing 24.2 million people, more than three times the number uprooted by conflict. This trend was at its most acute in east Asia and the Pacific. In China, 7.4 million were forced from their homes, with 5.9 million affected in the Philippines and a further 2.4 million in India. Floods accounted for half of all people displaced by disasters. In some cases, a complex mix of conflict and disaster has forced communities from their homes, the report?s authors noted. It pointed to the situations unfolding in Nigeria, South Sudan and Somalia, where drought combined with conflict and violence are fuelling displacement, severe food insecurity and famine. Bilak said the number of displacements due to violence in DRC was proof that the underlying conflicts cannot be ignored. ?Unless the crisis and the factors that lead to this crisis are addressed they will re-erupt on a cyclical basis.?In May last year, the UN proposed (pdf) that governments commit to reducing the number of internally displaced people by at least 50% by 2030. The report warned this is little more than an aspiration, however.Last year, more aid was spent on refugee resettlement within donor nations than in the countries where displacement crises originated.?What we focus on is the symptom of this breakdown of protection and human rights of people in their local communities. We just focus on the symptom, which is the people we see at our borders,? said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.He said there is a link with refugees ? though the vast majority of displaced people do not have the opportunity or means to cross borders.Six of the 10 countries that produced the most refugees in 2015 ? Afghanistan, Colombia, DRC, South Sudan and Syria ? were also among the 10 with the largest number of internally displaced people.Egeland warned that without political intervention the situation will only get worse. ?First, conflict resolution needs to be redoubled, tripled, quadrupled,? he said. ?It?s incredible there?s not a bigger pull towards a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni conflict. We also need to get economic life to countries like Yemen and elsewhere so there?s not a collapse in social structures there. Then we need investment in avoiding environmental degradation, and we need disaster risk reduction.?"
3259,Israeli PM orders ministers to attend Trump's welcome event,"Israel?s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has reportedly been forced to order his ministers to attend the airport reception for Donald Trump on Monday, after discovering that a number had planned not to attend.According to reports in the Israeli media, an angry Netanyahu was informed on Sunday that party heads and a number of ministers planned to skip the reception after the White House had asked for the meet and greet to be shortened to the two countries? anthems and handshakes only between Netanyahu and Trump.Haaretz, the Times of Israel and the Jerusalem Post all carried stories, some quoting an identified Israeli government official on the instruction from Netanyahu, amid claims that ministers had been upset at not being included in the receiving line on the airport tarmac.The row is the latest in a series of controversies to hit the planned visit of the US president, which officials in Israel have privately characterised as often haphazard.Trump will arrive for the whirlwind visit to Israel and to the occupied Palestinian territories on Monday, amid mounting questions over what ? if any ? practical steps he will take to advance his ?ultimate peace deal? between the two sides.Overshadowed by the escalating scandals surrounding him, the US president will meet Netanyahu and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, during 26 hours of events.Trump will arrive from Riyadh on Air Force One just before noon at Ben Gurion airport, accompanied by his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared, before flying by helicopter to Jerusalem.During his visit, Trump will briefly visit the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City, dine with Netanyahu and make a private visit to the Western Wall, Judaism?s most holy site. Then on Tuesday morning Trump will meet Abbas in Bethlehem before flying on to Rome.Speaking at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, ahead of Trump?s arrival, Netanyahu said: ?I will discuss with President Trump ways to strengthen our primary and steadfast ties with the United States. We will improve our security ties, which we are strengthening on a daily basis. We will also discuss ways to advance the peace.?The visit will take place under tight security with about 10,000 police securing the Israeli part of the visit, which will be accompanied by road closures. Trump will spend a single night in a suite in the King David hotel protected by glass capable of withstanding a rocket-propelled grenade and a poison gas attack. The visit comes at a tense time ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War in early June ? which for Palestinians marks five decades of occupation ? and amid a continuing hunger strike by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails that has prompted sometimes violent demonstrations on the West Bank.Trump?s problems at home are also seen by some as having cast a pall over the proceedings, with Dan Shapiro, the former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama, predicting: ?I think the trip?s in a lot of jeopardy [in] being able to be productive because of all the chaos and controversy that?s going on in Washington.? Despite the signs posted in Jerusalem neighbourhoods welcoming Trump as ?a friend of Zion? and calling on hims to ?make Israel great?, his visit is also causing anxieties for many on Israel?s right for whom Trump?s election was seen initially as the cause for unbridled celebration. Since his inauguration on 20 January, those same rightwingers fear that Trump has drifted towards an ever more conventional US foreign policy position on the peace process.Far from moving the US embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office ? as he promised ? Trump has kicked that issue into the long grass while expressing a sometimes garbled objection to Israeli settlement building.That has seen David Friedman, the controversial and pro-settler new US ambassador to Israel who arrived last week, move quickly to reassure Netanyahu?s government that Trump remains as firmly committed to Israel as ever, even as he suggested that no announcement on the US embassy would be made until after Trump?s visit.The messaging on the Israel-Palestine peace process has also been downbeat, with one US official telling Haaretz on Sunday that the height of Trump?s ambitions for his ?ultimate deal? right now appears to involve no more than encouraging the two sides to play nicely to create conditions for direct talks.?The president has made a general statement regarding his view on settlements and he hopes the Israeli government takes it into account,? the official said. ?He was also pretty direct with President Abbas regarding what they need to do regarding incitement and the payments to families of terrorists. He has been quite clear about that and he will be clear about that during the visit.?Instead, the expectation will be that Trump will neither outline a vision for a framework for the peace process nor any concrete steps. What noises that have emerged from reported leaks about Trump?s plans to advance peace suggest an implausible mishmash of ideas ? including the idea that Israel be allowed to continue settlement building during talks.On the Israeli side the most significant outcome is a proposal for improving the economic quality of life for Palestinians on the West Bank, including longer opening hours for the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, more building permits in the so-called area C and suggestions for new industrial zones on the West Bank.Lacking any clear prospects for a breakthrough, the runup to the visit has been dominated by mini ? and sometimes concocted ? controversies including the comment by a US official telling Netanyahu?s office that the Western Wall was not in Israeli territory.Trump will, however, become the first US president to visit the wall, a fact that was being spun last week by Jonathan Schanzer of the rightwing US Foundation for Defence of Democracies as a pro-Israel step.?I think that if Trump himself goes to the Western Wall and does it with Israeli officials, even Israeli security, there?s going to be very little argument over who controls it ? certainly [when] going there to acknowledge it as a Jewish holy site,? said Schanzer.On the Palestinian side, officials appear content that the worst predictions regarding Trump on the Middle East ? fuelled by his own campaign rhetoric ? have not materialised. ?We?re happy that, contrary to initial expectations, the Trump administration has been willing to listen,? one official said. ?Our readout is that Trump was surprised by Abbas?s declaration of his willingness to make peace, having being told the opposite by some of his advisers.?"
3260,Reliance Jio's Prime scheme is not driving demand: Report,"New Delhi, May 22 (PTI) The monthly subscriber report released by telecom regulator Trai for March shows that Reliance Jios low price 4G mobile service scheme Prime is not driving demand for its connections, while incumbents have gained, UBS Securities Asia said. ""March momentum favours incumbents, Jio Prime not driving demand pick-up. We are surprised to see lack of acceleration in March since Jio Prime offer was announced in the month.

3262,Diamond ring bought for ?900 expected to fetch ?3 crore,"A large diamond ring is expected to fetch  350,000 at auction 30 years after its owner paid  10 for it at a car boot sale, thinking it was a costume jewel.The ?exceptionally sized? stone was presumed not to be real because 19th-century diamonds were not cut to show off their brilliance like today?s gems. The owner, unaware of its value, wore it for decades, while doing everything from the shopping to the chores.The 26.27-carat, cushion-shaped, white diamond, snapped up at a Sunday sale at the West Middlesex hospital in Isleworth in west London in the 1980s, is going under the hammer at Sotheby?s on 7 June. The head of the auction house?s London jewellery department, Jessica Wyndham, said: ?The owner would wear it out shopping, wear it day-to-day. It?s a good-looking ring. But it was bought as a costume jewel. No one had any idea it had any intrinsic value at all. They enjoyed it all this time.?They had been to quite a few car boot sales over the years. But they don?t have any history of collecting antiques and they don?t have any history of collecting diamonds. This is a one-off windfall, an amazing find.?Wyndham said that after about 30 years of wearing the ring, the owners brought it into Sotheby?s after a jeweller told them it could have substantial value.?They came in with the idea that it might be real and they had no idea of its value,? she said. ?We had a look and said ? I think that?s a diamond, and we got it tested at the Gemological Institute of America. The majority of us can?t even begin to dream of owning a diamond that large.? Wyndham said the owners, who did not want to be named, are ?incredibly excited. Anyone would be in this position. It?s a life-changing amount of money. No matter what your background is or what your past experiences have been, it?s going to revolutionise someone?s life?.The diamond is thought to have been cut in the 19th century but its history and how it arrived at the car boot sale are unknown.Wyndham said the older style of diamond cutting was ?slightly duller and deeper than you would see in a modern style ? it could trick people into thinking it?s not a genuine stone?.She added: ?The diamond cutter is looking to maximise the amount of brilliance from the stone because that?s what makes it sparkly,? she said.?With an old style of cutting, an antique cushion shape, the light doesn?t reflect back as much as it would from a modern stone cutting. Cutters worked more with the natural shape of the crystal, to conserve as much weight of the crystal rather than make it as brilliant as possible. The older stones have quite a bit of personality. They sparkle in a different way.??Serendipity? may have prompted the owners to buy the ring in the first place, she said, ?but a 26-carat, cushion-shaped diamond, no matter how filthy or dark that mount was, maybe that stone still speaks to people. They also bought some designer dresses for about  10. We should have all been at the car sale!?"

3265,Leak reveals how Facebook deals with controversial content,"Facebook?s secret rules and guidelines for deciding what its 2 billion users can post on the site are revealed for the first time in a Guardian investigation that will fuel the global debate about the role and ethics of the social media giant.The Guardian has seen more than 100 internal training manuals, spreadsheets and flowcharts that give unprecedented insight into the blueprints Facebook has used to moderate issues such as violence, hate speech, terrorism, pornography, racism and self-harm.There are even guidelines on match-fixing and cannibalism.The Facebook Files give the first view of the codes and rules formulated by the site, which is under huge political pressure in Europe and the US.They illustrate difficulties faced by executives scrabbling to react to new challenges such as ?revenge porn? ? and the challenges for moderators, who say they are overwhelmed by the volume of work, which means they often have ?just 10 seconds? to make a decision.?Facebook cannot keep control of its content,? said one source. ?It has grown too big, too quickly.?Many moderators are said to have concerns about the inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies. Those on sexual content, for example, are said to be the most complex and confusing.One document says Facebook reviews more than 6.5m reports a week relating to potentially fake accounts ? known as FNRP (fake, not real person).Using thousands of slides and pictures, Facebook sets out guidelines that may worry critics who say the service is now a publisher and must do more to remove hateful, hurtful and violent content.Yet these blueprints may also alarm free speech advocates concerned about Facebook?s de facto role as the world?s largest censor. Both sides are likely to demand greater transparency.The Guardian has seen documents supplied to Facebook moderators within the last year. The files tell them:Other types of remarks that can be permitted by the documents include: ?Little girl needs to keep to herself before daddy breaks her face,? and ?I hope someone kills you.? The threats are regarded as either generic or not credible.In one of the leaked documents, Facebook acknowledges ?people use violent language to express frustration online? and feel ?safe to do so? on the site.It says: ?They feel that the issue won?t come back to them and they feel indifferent towards the person they are making the threats about because of the lack of empathy created by communication via devices as opposed to face to face.?We should say that violent language is most often not credible until specificity of language gives us a reasonable ground to accept that there is no longer simply an expression of emotion but a transition to a plot or design. From this perspective language such as ?I?m going to kill you? or ?Fuck off and die? is not credible and is a violent expression of dislike and frustration.?It adds: ?People commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in generally facetious and unserious ways.?Facebook conceded that ?not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our community standards?.Monika Bickert, ?Facebook?s head of global policy management, said the service had almost 2 billion users and that it was difficult to reach a consensus on what to allow.?We have a really diverse global community and people are going to have very different ideas about what is OK to share. No matter where you draw the line there are always going to be some grey areas. For instance, the line between satire and humour and inappropriate content is sometimes very grey. It is very difficult to decide whether some things belong on the site or not,? she said.?We feel responsible to our community to keep them safe and we feel very accountable. It?s absolutely our responsibility to keep on top of it. It?s a company commitment. We will continue to invest in proactively keeping the site safe, but we also want to empower people to report to us any content that breaches our standards.?She said some offensive comments may violate Facebook policies in some contexts, but not in others.  Facebook?s leaked policies on subjects including violent death, images of non-sexual physical child abuse and animal cruelty show how the site tries to navigate a minefield.The files say: ?Videos of violent deaths are disturbing but can help create awareness. For videos, we think minors need protection and adults need a choice. We mark as ?disturbing? videos of the violent deaths of humans.?Such footage should be ?hidden from minors? but not automatically deleted because it can ?be valuable in creating awareness for self-harm afflictions and mental illness or war crimes and other important issues?.Regarding non-sexual child abuse, Facebook says: ?We do not action photos of child abuse. We mark as disturbing videos of child abuse. We remove imagery of child abuse if shared with sadism and celebration.?One slide explains Facebook does not automatically delete evidence of non-sexual child abuse to allow the material to be shared so ?the child [can] be identified and rescued, but we add protections to shield the audience?. This might be a warning on the video that the content is disturbing.Facebook confirmed there are ?some situations where we do allow images of non-sexual abuse of a child for the purpose of helping the child?.Its policies on animal abuse are also explained, with one slide saying: ?We allow photos and videos documenting animal abuse for awareness, but may add viewer protections to some content that is perceived as extremely disturbing by the audience.?Generally, imagery of animal abuse can be shared on the site. Some extremely disturbing imagery may be marked as disturbing.? Photos of animal mutilation, including those showing torture, can be marked as disturbing rather than deleted. Moderators can also leave photos of abuse where a human kicks or beats an animal. Facebook said: ?We allow people to share images of animal abuse to raise awareness and condemn the abuse but remove content that celebrates cruelty against animals.?The files show Facebook has issued new guidelines on nudity after last year?s outcry when it removed an iconic Vietnam war photo because the girl in the picture was naked.It now allows for ?newsworthy exceptions? under its ?terror of war? guidelines but draws the line at images of ?child nudity in the context of the Holocaust?. Facebook told the Guardian it was using software to intercept some graphic content before it got on the site, but that ?we want people to be able to discuss global and current events ? so the context in which a violent image is shared sometimes matters?.Some critics in the US and Europe have demanded that the company be regulated in the same way as mainstream broadcasters and publishers.But Bickert said Facebook was ?a new kind of company. It?s not a traditional technology company. It?s not a traditional media company. We build technology, and we feel responsible for how it?s used. We don?t write the news that people read on the platform.?A report by British MPs published on 1 May said ?the biggest and richest social media companies are shamefully far from taking sufficient action to tackle illegal or dangerous content, to implement proper community standards or to keep their users safe?.Sarah T Roberts, an expert on content moderation, said: ?It?s one thing when you?re a small online community with a group of people who share principles and values, but when you have a large percentage of the world?s population and say ?share yourself?, you are going to be in quite a muddle. ?Then when you monetise that practice you are entering a disaster situation.?Facebook has consistently struggled to assess the news or ?awareness? value of violent imagery. While the company recently faced harsh criticism for failing to remove videos of Robert Godwin being killed in the US and of a father killing his child in Thailand, the platform has also played an important role in disseminating videos of police killings and other government abuses.In 2016, Facebook removed a video showing the immediate aftermath of the fatal police shooting of Philando Castile but subsequently reinstated the footage, saying the deletion was a ?mistake?.

3266,India a victim of terrorism: Donald Trump,"United States President Donald Trump, during his speech at the Arab-Islamic-US summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, acknowledged that India is a victim of terrorism and said, without explicitly naming Pakistan, that every country must ensure that terrorists don't find sanctuaries within their borders. ""India, Russia, China, and Australia have all been victims"" of terrorism, Trump said, adding that the countries, as well as the US and Europe, have ""suffered repeated barbaric attacks"" and have ""endured unspeakable horror"". In a carefully worded speech delivered at a gathering of about 50 leaders of Muslim-majority countries, Trump did not use his signature phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"", a term he often used during his campaign for the US president. Trump, however, called upon the Middle East and Muslim countries to do their bit to defeat terrorism (Full text of Donald Trump's speech). ""Terrorism has spread all across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land"", Trump said. ""Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion.""Urging countries to deny terrorists space to operate, Trump said, ""The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil...Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil.""Terming the Middle East as a holy land, Trump urged countries in the region to ""drive out"" terrorists. ""A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and drive out the extremists. Drive them out! Drive them out of your places of worship, drive them out of your communities, drive them out of your holy land and drive them out of this earth,"" the president said. ATTACKS IRAN Trump went on to criticise Iran, which just saw President Hassan Rouhani win a re-election bid, saying the country has ""for decades...fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror."" ""It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room"", Trump added.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back on Twitter, posting a seemingly sarcastic tweet that read "" Iran-fresh from real elections-attacked by @POTUS in that bastion of democracy & moderation"" Saudi Arabia. Zarif indicated that Trump had during his Saudi Arabia visit milked his hosts of hundreds of billions of dollars in business deals. Trump signed deals worth nearly $400 billion. In his speech, Trump said the agreements will ""create many hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia."" The agreements include a $110 billion Saudi-funded defense purchase. Trump said the US will ensure that its ""Saudi friends"" get a good deal from ""our great American defense companies, the greatest anywhere in the world."" ""This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a far greater role in security and operations having to do with security"", Trump added. (With agency inputs)"
3267,Indian national arrested in Pakistan,"An Indian national has been arrested in Islamabad on Sunday allegedly over incomplete travel documents. According to Pakistan local media, a case has also been filed under Article 14 of the Foreign Act. According to police, the man identified as Sheikh Nabi, a resident of Mumbai, was detained during routine patrol in F-8 area of the capital on May 19 after he failed to produce any travel or visa documents. According to police, Nabi was walking along Nazimuddin Road in Sector F-8 when he was stopped at a check post. Police demanded to check his visa documents after he told them that he was an Indian. However, he could not produce any documents and was taken into police custody. An official of the Indian High Commission, however, said that the mission does not have any information about the arrest so far.The arrest came days after the International Court of Justice stayed the execution of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of ""involvement in espionage and sabotage activities"" against the country.The ""suspicious person"" has been booked under the Foreigners Act, 1946. Police have also obtained 14 days judicial remand through a magistrate.Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs has said that it is ascertaining facts regarding the arrest of the Indian held in Islamabad, allegedly for incomplete travel documents.(With inputs from PTI) Also read: Madhya Pradesh: Two naxal funding operatives arrested in Balaghat"
3268,Pakistan lawyers give PM Sharif 7-day deadline to resign,"The Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association have said they would launch a countrywide movement if Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif doesn't resign on the Panama Papers scandal in seven days. According to a report by The Dawn, the two bar associations in a joint declaration said that following the Supreme Court's order on the Panama Papers case, the Prime Minister should no longer hold the position and resign within seven days.This comes after the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association members clashed with the lawyers supporting the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML_N) government. The incident took place at the all Pakistan lawyers' representatives' convention on May 19.SCBA President Rasheed A Rizvi was locked in the Lahore High Court's library by PML-N lawyers. The locks were broken by SCBA members and Rizvi was released during the ruckus. Police were called in to control the situation.""Both bar associations are of the view that in light of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Panama Papers case (that questioned the moral authority of the premier to rule), PM Nawaz Sharif should no longer hold his office and should therefore resign,"" a joint statement issued by the both bar associations said after their convention in Lahore.It said the judgement in the Panama case has clearly indicted Sharif and his children for financial improprieties and corruption and a joint investigation team has been formed to probe him.""For fair and independent inquiry against the premier, Nawaz Sharif should step down till the final report of the JIT. In case he does not resign till May 27 the lawyers throughout Pakistan will launch a nationwide campaign and movement to ensure his resignation,"" the statement said.

3269,Thugs Of Hindostan not based on Pirates of Caribbean: Aamir,"Aamir Khan's action-adventure film, Thugs Of Hindostan, is said to be based on the thug culture in 19th century India. The subject, many felt, was similar to Hollywood's Pirates Of The Caribbean series. At a recent media interaction, Aamir rubbished the rumours of his film being inspired by the Johnny Depp-starrer.""The film is not inspired from any other film. It is an action adventure film but the story is not similar. There are some hundreds of action adventure films. There is Pirates Of The Caribbean, there is Indiana Jones and many others.

Even my character in the film is not similar to any other character,"" he said.Talking about his leading lady in Thugs Of Hindostan and onscreen daughter in Dangal, Fatima Sana Shaikh, Aamir said, ""Fatima is the heroine of the film. I am very happy as she is a very good artist, she suits the role.""Thugs of Hindostan, directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, will also feature Amitabh Bachchan and Katrina Kaif in leading roles. The film is reportedly scheduled to release in 2018. (With inputs from IANS) "
3270,"ICSE, ISC students to get digital marksheets from this year","Kolkata, May 20 (PTI) ICSE and ISC candidates will now be able to have digital versions of their marksheets and certificates for accessing them anytime and anywhere. ""Unlike the old practice when the candidates had to download the scanned image of the hard copy of marksheet, all they have to do now is to open an account with http://digilocker.gov.in and give their mobile number and follow the steps thereafter,"" Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) Chief Executive and Secretary Gerry Arathoon told PTI today.

3271,Kulbhushan bigger terrorist than Kasab: Pervez Musharraf,"Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on Friday said that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a bigger terrorist than Ajmal Kasab, one of the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which more than 150 people were killed. Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in April this year on charges of espionage. Pakistan alleges that Jadhav is a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and is responsible for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, the troubled Pakistani region where Islamabad has long accused RAW of promoting terrorism.In an interview to Pakistan's ARY News, Musharraf drew parallels between Jadhav and Kasab, who was hanged to death in India for his role in the Mumbai attacks. Musharraf said Kasab was just a ""pawn"" while Jadhav is responsible for getting ""dozens of people"" to carry out terrorist activities. ""Who is a bigger culprit (between Jadhav and Kasab),"" Musharraf rhetorically asked, before saying, ""Obviously it is Jadhav."" ""I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for,"" Musharraf added.The former Pakistani army chief also slammed his country for appearing in the International Court of Justice, which this week put a stay on Jadhav's death sentence. ""It was wrong that India went to the ICJ,"" Musharraf said, adding, ""Pakistan should not have gone (to the ICJ"". Issues of espionage and sabotage are Pakistan's internal matters, Musharraf added, saying no one has the authority to advise his country on these issues. He also went on to indicate that world bodies like the United Nations and the International Court of Justice don't have any real power. Directives issued by these world bodies are ignored by some countries, Musharraf said when asked whether Pakistan could have realistically avoided sending a team to the ICJ to defend against India's claim. Musharraf went on to cite the example of the United States executing two German nationals in 1999 despite an ICJ provisional ruling putting a stay on the death penalty awarded to the two. THE KULBHUSHAN JADHAV ISSUE In April this year, Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence handed to Kulbhushan Jadhav, accused of spying.India, which slammed Jadhav's trial as 'farcical', said that Jadhav is not a spy and that he is a former Indian Navy officer-turned businessman who was kidnapped in Iran and taken to Pakistan. Contending that Islamabad had violated the Vienna Convention by not providing New Delhi consular access to Jadhav, India filed a petition at The Hague, Netherlands-based ICJ. This week, the World Court, allowing India's plea, asked Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until the ICJ has had the time to hear the matter in full and arrive at a final verdict.ALSO READ: How Pakistani media reported ICJ stay on Kulbhushan Jadhav's death sentence"
3272,Kerala CM praises girl who chopped off her rapist's penis,"Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has praised the 22-year-old girl who chopped off her serial rapist's penis in Thiruvananthapuram.""It was a courageous step, no doubt about it,"" an ANI report quoted said Vijayan.It was a courageous step, no doubt about it:Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan on girl who chopped off genitals of inmate from Panmana Ashram pic.twitter.com/67xqy3PDNBThe 22-year-old girl told the police that the sanyasi, an inmate from Panmana Ashram, had been repeatedly raping her for the past seven years. ""My father is paralyzed and bedridden. My mother invited Swami for conducting pooja and offering prayers three years ago. He is a frequent visitor to our home,"" she said.""Seven years ago, he started raping me. I was scared to resist him. When he tried to rape me on Friday night, I chopped off his sexual organ,"" the survivor told the police.Since the girl was still a minor seven years back, when she claims the sexual assault started, the police registered a criminal case against the sanyasi under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POSCO).The girl's family, upon finding their sanyasi in a bloodied state, rushed him to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, where he was declared to be in a ""critical condition"".Police told India Today that they have not registered a case against the girl as she acted in self defense."
3273,H-1B visas for Indian IT companies won't come down: Minister,"New Delhi, May 20 (PTI) Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today sought to calm frayed nerves on the contentious visa issue, saying the number of H-1B visas for Indian IT professionals would not come down. She asked the industry not to get panicky. ""No need to get panicky on the visa front. The lottery process is something I suppose they (the US) wanted to do a correction on. The numbers are not something they are changing... the numbers will not come down,"" Sitharaman told reporters here. Over the past few weeks, there is a growing sentiment of protectionism across various developed economies, including the US, seeking to safeguard jobs for locals and raise the bar for foreign workers. In the US, the Trump administration wants to replace the current lottery system with a more merit-based immigration policy. A mere 17 per cent of total US visas go to Indian companies and a number of American firms benefit from services provided by Indian firms, she noted. India has time and again expressed hope that the review of H-1B visa process will take into consideration the positive relationship between the two countries. Any change in visa norms can affect the movement of labour as well as spike operational costs for IT players. In response to the proposed tightening of the visa regime, Indian IT firms have been ramping up hiring of locals in the US, a market that accounts for almost 60 per cent of the Indias technology export revenues. On changes in the selection process for H-1B visa, the minister hoped that ""where the high skill set is required, they (US) would look for that, rather than for first time graduates"". The selection for such visas is getting selective, but the ""numbers are not changing"". ""No need of getting panicky... because the number of H-1B visas that we have got, we will continue to get that,"" she promised. US President Donald Trump in April had signed an executive order for tightening the H-1B visa programme to stop its ""abuse"" and ensure the visas are given to the ""most- skilled or highest paid"" petitioners, a decision that is seen to impact Indias USD 150 billion IT industry. The Indian IT industry expressed serious concern over the issue as these visas were mainly used for short-term work in the US. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. Indian technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year for their US operations. "
3274,Treat first 9 months under GST as trial period: Trade body,"New Delhi, May 19 (PTI) Traders body CAIT today suggested the first nine months of GST, from its rollout date of July 1, should be treated as a trial period and no punitive action taken against businesses for procedural mistakes to allow them to get familiarised with the new regime. Commenting on the outcome of the GST Council meeting that concluded today, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that classification of goods under different tax slabs of GST are by and large fitted in the correct basket and it is expected that goods will become cheaper under the new indirect tax regime. ""However, on the other side, several items which have been placed under higher category of tax rate will disturb the pricing structure and pinch the common man,"" said B C Bhartia, president of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). He pointed out that items like pickles, sauces, and instant mixer pertaining to food processing which are consumed by large number of people, have been placed under the higher tax rate of 18 per cent. The CAIT further said that while the GST should be implemented from the scheduled date of July 1, the remaining nine months of the current fiscal ""may be declared as trial period"" and except habitual offenders, no action should be taken against traders for procedural mistakes.

3275,Cut penis myself as it was of no use: Swami accused of rape,"A 54-year-old swami in Kerala whose penis was cut off by a 22-year-old law student has now claimed that it was he himself ""who chopped off his sexual organ"" as it was ""not useful"" for him.The sanyasi's comments are from the statement he gave Kerala Police after being charged under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act for repeatedly raping the now 22-year-old woman over a period of seven years. According to the police, the swami is a resident of the Padmana Chattambi Swami Ashram, which he joined 15 years ago after deciding to become a spiritual guru."
3276,'Doomsday' vault flooded after surrounding soil melts,"It was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world?s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity?s food supply forever. But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide ?failsafe? protection against ?the challenge of natural or man-made disasters?.But soaring temperatures in the Arctic at the end of the world?s hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling. ?It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,? said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.?A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in,? she told the Guardian. Fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18C.But the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. ?It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,? Aschim said. ?We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.?The vault?s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet. The end of 2016 saw average temperatures over 7C above normal on Spitsbergen, pushing the permafrost above melting point.?The question is whether this is just happening now, or will it escalate?? said Aschim. The Svalbard archipelago, of which Spitsbergen is part, has warmed rapidly in recent decades, according to Ketil Isaksen, from Norway?s Meteorological Institute. ?The Arctic and especially Svalbard warms up faster than the rest of the world. The climate is changing dramatically and we are all amazed at how quickly it is going,? Isaksen told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet.The vault managers are now taking precautions, including major work to waterproof the 100m-long tunnel into the mountain and digging trenches into the mountainside to channel meltwater and rain away. They have also removed electrical equipment from the tunnel that produced some heat and installed pumps in the vault itself in case of a future flood.Aschim said there was no option but to find solutions to ensure the enduring safety of the vault: ?We have to find solutions. It is a big responsibility and we take it very seriously. We are doing this for the world.??This is supposed to last for eternity,? said  smund Asdal at the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre, which operates the seed vault."

The making off the film started in 2012 and will hit the theatres on May 26.""When Ravi (Bhagchandka, producer) met me in 2012, his idea was that the life of other sports personalities have been covered so there should be a film on my life.

3279,My fees not even 10% of what rumour says: Pak lawyer at ICJ,"According to a Geo News report, Khawar Qureshi, the lawyer representing Pakistan at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has blamed the Indian government for the 'baseless propaganda' surrounding the case fee he charged, something that became a rallying point for many on the social media to poke fun at him. What exacerbated his misery was the obvious comparison with Harish Salve, the Indian counsel in the case, who took just Re 1 as his court fee, a symbolism of his commitment to his motherland.The lawyer, who has been blamed by many experts and politicians in Pakistan for not preparing well for the case and leaving many loopholes in his arguments, told Geo News that ""references to his fees were complete lies fabricated by Indian Twitterati and Indian nationals behind such baseless propaganda may have government backing"".The ICJ decision yesterday, staying execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan till the case was underway in the UN court, saw a rush of tweets on how a highly paid but ill-prepared Pak lawyer could not stand the legal wisdom of Harish Salve who charged just Re 1. The speculation on Twitter about his fees was largely based on media reports from Pakistan that quoted his fees for the case at around 5,00,000 British Pound, i.e., a whopping 7 crore in Pak currency and around 4.25 crore in Indian currency.So, even if Qureshi says that ""his fees were not even 10 per cent of what the Indian propaganda suggests"" and even if he justifies the amount he charged by saying he ""cancelled another professional commitment with another government to travel to Pakistan urgently"", he would always find it difficult to justify even this reduced gap, i.e., at 10 per cent of the claims being made, between Harish Salve's Re 1 winning gesture to his Rs. 42.5 lakh case fee, especially when he wasted 40 minutes of the 90 minutes given to his team to present its side of the arguments. To add to Qureshi's misery, Indian team under the leadership of Salve used its full 90 minutes.Qureshi might have given ""a 30 per cent reduction on his fees, besides covering the cost of two of his juniors' fees"", as he claims, the bottom line is, he is being slammed in Pakistan for mishandling the case and his high fees, even at 30 per cent discount, is not giving him any room to breathe easy because Pakistan has made Kulbhushan Jadhav's case a prestige issue and the yesterday debacle saw a mourning like atmosphere there.It is true that the ICJ has given only an interim stay of Jadhav's execution and Pakistan and Qureshi say they have enough evidence to prove their case in the course of hearing, the truth of the moment is, India has scored a clear diplomatic victory over Pakistan and a moral boost for further case proceedings at the ICJ.Earlier in the day, a news came from Pakistan that it was going to have a new legal team for the case, but now Pakistan has filed a plea in the ICJ to rehear the case within six weeks with reports saying that Qureshi will continue to represent Pakistan. So, now that Qureshi is going to remain there, he has now the opportunity to silence his critics, both on his legal acumen in the case and on his exorbitant fee. Let's see if he can match Harish Salve.ALSO READ:Pakistan's plan ahead after Nawaz Sharif govt slammed on ICJ's Kulbhushan rulingKulbhushan Jadhav case: Pakistan set to re-challenge International Court of Justice's jurisdiction"

3290,Rotten system needs to be changed: Rajinikanth on politics,"""Will he or won't?"" is the million dollar question in the minds of common men in Tamil Nadu over speculations that superstar Rajinikanth is taking the political plunge. Dropping what is perhaps his biggest hint so far on joining politics, Thalaiva today said the ""system is rotten and needs revamp"".""We have good leaders like Stalin (MK), Anbumani (Ramadoss) and Seeman. But what do we do when the system is rotten, democracy has deteriorated. This system needs to be changed and a change has to be brought in the minds of people, then only will the country flourish,"" he said.""I have my profession, my job. I have some responsibilities and you have your jobs. Go back to your respective places and do your job. Let's meet when it's time for the war,"" Rajinikanth roared amidst thundering applause from fans.Shooting down the outsider tag, Rajinikanth said he is a pure Tamil now despite his origins from Karnataka. ""Even though I am from Karnataka, still you have accepted me and you have made me into a Tamil. I am a pure Tamil now,"" the superstar said in Chennai. ""I lived in Karnataka for 23 years and Tamil Nadu for 43 years. Although I came as a Marathi from Karnataka, you people nurtured me, made me true Tamilian,"" he said.Thalaiva once again did not clarify whether or not he is joining Tamil Nadu politics. ""Without opposition, there is no entry into politics"" was his cryptic message to his fans, the superstar's meeting with them becoming more frequent lately.With Tamil stalwarts like late J Jayalalithaa and ailing DMK supremo M Karunanidhi out of the picture in the current dispensation, Rajinikanth's fans believe he is the only one who can effectively fill the political vacuum in the state. Earlier this week, the megastar had set tongues wagging with his remarks that that if he joined politics, he would show the door to all ""money-minded"" people. He, however, added that he had no desire to enter the fray, but did not know ""what God had in store for him"".In 1996, the 67-year-old actor had supported the DMK-TMC against J Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, and the alliance swept the polls that year. But he has not been involved in any political activity since then. BJP TRYING TO WOO THALAIVAThe BJP has been trying to rope in the superstar for its entry into the turbulent Tamil Nadu politics. Recently, BJP national secretary H Raja said Rajinikanth is a ""popular"" personality and is welcome to join the saffron party.""He has every right to form a political party or join politics. But so far he has not taken a firm stand. So we have to wait and see. Anybody willing to join the BJP under Narendra Modi's leadership is welcome,"" Raja said.Opposition DMK's acting chief MK Stalin today said he is happy Rajinikanth called him a good leader and that he shouldn't fall for the BJP's wooing. ""I am happy he called me a good leader. The BJP is trying to woo him, but he shouldn't fall (for it). Let Rajini take his decision on politics,"" he told India Today TV."
3291,Pak to get new team of lawyers after ICJ ruling,"After suffering a major setback at the International Court of Justice in the Kulbhushan Jadhav death penalty case, Pakistan is set to replace the lawyers that represented the country at the World Court, Pakistani media reports said. Sartaj Aziz, the foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was quoted by The Nation as saying that Islamabad will appoint a new team of lawyers to defend Pakistan's position at the The Hague, Netherlands-based International Court of Justice. The Pakistani legal team was led by Khawar Qureshi who faced off against Harish Salve on Monday when both argued their respective countries' position on the Jadhav death penalty matter.State-run news agency Associated Press of Pakistan further reported Aziz saying that Qureshi had courageously represented Pakistan at the International Court of Justice. The ICJ on Thursday allowed India's petition that Pakistan be directed not to execute Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was handed a death sentence by a Pakistani military court in April this year. The ICJ, accepting India's plea, said Pakistan must not hang Jadhav until the court hears the matter in full and that Islamabad must inform the World Court of the steps it has taken to ensure that the Indian national is not executed.Responding to the ICJ order, Aziz, Pakistan's de facto foreign minister, was reported to have said, ""Pakistan's security is so important and we have to maintain our fundamental sovereign right.""PAK ARGUMENT REJECTEDPresident Judge Ronny Abraham, while delivering ICJ's interim verdict on the Jadhav death penalty case, rejected Pakistan's contention that the World Court has no jurisdiction on the matter. Prima facie, the ICJ has jurisdiction on the Jadhav case, Abraham said, rejecting one of the Islamabad's main arguments against the Indian case. Invoking the Optional Protocol of the Vienna Convention, India had contended that the International Court of Justice has the jurisdiction to take up the Jadhav death penalty case. Notably, the ICJ did not rule on India's main argument that Kulbhushan Jadhav's trial in Pakistan was in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Access.Since Jadhav's arrest in 2016, Pakistan has rejected 16 Indian requests for consular access. Islamabad has claimed that since Jadhav is charged under the country's espionage laws, it does not need to provide New Delhi with consular access. Having ordered Pakistan not to execute Jadhav, the ICJ will now seek comprehensive submissions from both New Delhi and Islamabad on their respective cases. The dates or the schedule of upcoming hearings at The Hague have not yet been announced, but it is likely that the process will take years.THE KULBHUSHAN JADHAV CASEIn April this year, the Directorate of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Pakistan military wing, announced that Jadhav, whom Islamabad accuses of being a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and of fomenting unrest in Balochistan, was sentenced to die by a Pakistani army court. Jadhav's death sentence was confirmed by Pakistani army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa. India, who said Jadhav is a retired Indian Navy officer-turned businessman, slammed Pakistan for carrying out a secretive, ""farcical"" trial. New Delhi then dragged Islamabad to the International Court of Justice. Pakistan has said that Jadhav has until August to seek mercy. ICJ President judge Ronny Abraham noted that this could mean that Jadhav could be executed soon after August (if a mercy plea is rejected), by when the ICJ may not be able to completely hear the matter and deliver its final verdict.ALSO READ: Nawaz Sharif feels the heat as Opposition slams government for mishandling Kulbhushan Jadhav's case at ICJICJ verdict is fine but can Kulbhushan Jadhav be saved?

Right now I don't feel it's necessary.""""Yes, sometimes it's difficult to give time to a relationship. But I don't believe it's impossible. If you want to have a relationship, you will manage to balance it with work,"" she added. Shraddha might not be looking for a boyfriend right now, but she believes that love can happen any time. ""Earlier, I was like, my man should have a good sense of humour, a sense of adventure. But now I realise that love can happen with anyone, any time, anywhere. And when it happens, I won't be checking for those qualities in him. Because when you connect with someone, that's all that matters.""When asked if she has been a possessive girlfriend, Shraddha said, ""Yes, I have been one. But I don't want to be a possessive girlfriend anymore. I want to give space to that person. Allow them to do what they want.""Shraddha's love life has made headlines in the recent past and the actor revealed the rumours of her dating Farhan have affected her in a certain way, but now she has learnt to ignore them. ""What I can't control, I ignore. Because there's no truth in it. And my focus is films. I don't focus on rubbish stories that people write about me. As actors we work hard to deliver a good performance. Reporters should be responsible when they write about us. Link-up rumours are not fair. It affects my family also. But now I have learnt to ignore it,"" she added. On the work front, she will be seen romancing Arjun Kapoor in Half Girlfriend. "

3297,Nestl  loses bid to trademark four-finger shape of KitKat,"It?s enough to make anyone need a sit-down with a cup of tea and a four-fingered chocolate wafer biscuit. The confectionery multinational Nestl  has lost the latest round of its long-running battle with rivals Cadbury to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar in the UK. The court of appeal ruled that the four-finger design had ?no inherent distinctiveness?.After deliberating for months, the three appeals judges delivered their judgment on Wednesday in a 16,000-word ruling that found the KitKat shape was not a ?badge of origin?.?We are concerned here with ... the three-dimensional shape of a chocolate product, that has no inherent distinctiveness,? said Lord Justice Kitchin.The ruling marks the latest stage in a bitter-tasting battle between Nestl  and Mondel?z, the US owner of Cadbury, that have been battling over the KitKat trademark for seven years.Nestle?s appeal followed a UK high court ruling in January last year that blocked the trademark attempt. The European court of justice had previously found that the four-fingered shape, breaking apart with a snap, was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law.The ruling clears the way for competitors, including the major supermarkets as well as other confectioners, to produce their own copycat KitKats without fear of legal consequences.But a Nestl  spokesperson indicated the Swiss firm was not necessarily prepared to give up, saying it was considering its next move. The company could potentially try to take the case to the UK supreme court.?Nestl  is disappointed by the court of appeal judgment and is considering its next steps,? said the spokesperson. ?KitKat is much loved around the world and its four-finger shape is well known by consumers. Nestl ?s four-finger shape has been granted trademark registration in many countries of the world, for instance Germany, France, Australia, South Africa and Canada, further protecting it from imitations.?Following the appeal ruling, a Mondel?z spokesperson said: ?As we have previously stated, we do not believe the shape of the KitKat bar should be protected as a trademark in the UK.?The case turned on whether a the product?s shapewas sufficiently distinctive to the brand to prevent any other manufacturer using a similar format. Protected ?shape marks? are not without precedent ? Toblerone, which is owned by Mondel?z, has successfully trademarked its ?zigzag prism? shape.But the appeal judges found that while the four-finger shape might be ?very well known? in association with KitKat, ?that does not necessarily mean that the public have come to perceive the shape as a badge of origin such that they would rely upon it alone to identify the product as coming from a particular source.?They might simply regard the shape as a characteristic of products of that kind or they might find it brings to mind the product and brand name with which they have become familiar.?These kinds of recognition and association do not amount to distinctiveness for trademark purposes.?The judges also noted that the chocolate bar?s shape had not been central to its marketing in recent years: ?It has nothing, therefore, to do with the informed choices that consumers make between similar products.?The judges heard that Nestl  had spent between  3m and  11m a year advertising and promoting KitKats between 1996 and 2007. More than 40m were sold in Britain in 2010.?The appeal court?s ruling indicates that shape marks are going to be increasingly difficult to obtain,? said Guy Wilmot, partner who specialises in intellectual property law at Russell-Cooke.?The court were ... concerned that if they granted the trade mark, Nestl  would have a potentially permanent monopoly on the four-finger shape, which they felt would be unfair given that KitKat had never used the shape alone to promote KitKats.?Clare Jackman, an intellectual property lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, said the fact the two multinationals were prepared to battle through the courts for so long showed the value of what was at stake. ?Trademarks are very important and valuable business assets. They confer monopoly rights, so I can see entirely why Nestl  thought, ?our four-finger bar KitKat has been around for ages, let?s register it, because we can stop anyone from producing a bar in four fingers??, she said.?It is typically brand owners in this space that will spend the money and push the boundaries, in trying to get as much protection as possible, because at the end of the day trademarks can potentially last forever, so it really is a signficant monopoly right.?Asked if she could foresee a challenge in supreme court, Jackman said: ?I?m not going to rule it out, because I think these are two brand owners who are prepared to push this as far as it can go.?The four-fingered battle is not the only protracted legal disputes between the two confectioners. In 2004, Cadbury attempted to trademark the shade of purple it uses for its Dairy Milk bars, registering Pantone 2685C in a move that was initially successful before the court of appeal backed Nestl  challenge in 2013. An attempt last year by Cadbury to resurrect an earlier trademark on the colour was rejected by the high court.The first KitKat-type bar was sold in Britain by Rowntree in 1935, when it was called Chocolate Crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. Nestl  acquired Rowntree in 1998.A lookalike called Kvikk Lunsj, translated as ?quick lunch?, launched in Norway in 1937 and is available in some UK shops.? This article was amended on 18 May 2017. The judge?s ruling was not a ?badge of origin?, a previous version said the judge?s ruling was not a ?badge or origin?."

WATCH VIDEOGeneral Singh has also demanded that people like Syed Ali Shah Geelani should not be allowed to live in relative comfort while under house arrest.Instead, Singh wants that the Hurriyat leaders be locked up in central prisons on terrorism charges. He congratulated the India Today Group for Hurriyat Truth Tapes and described the special investigation as the most compelling evidence ever gathered against the 'terrorists' in the Hurriyat because the Hurriyat leaders have themselves admitted that they are paid by Pakistan to burn schools in Kashmir.General Singh said the onus is now on the Mehbooba Mufti government to commence immediate and unprecedented clampdown on the Hurriyat Conference leaders who only care about the well being of their own families and are nothing but stooges of Pakistan.India Today aired a special investigative report where Hurriyat's Provincial President (Geelani Faction) Naeem Khan was caught on camera admitting that Pakistan is funding violence in the Kashmir Valley.Several top Kashmiri separatists were also caught on camera confessing to receiving funds from across the border.Some of them also admitted they raised money domestically, pledging to repeat the deadly events of 2016 if financed again. The stunning probe that rips apart the devious designs of anti-India forces in Kashmir includes Hurriyat's Provincial President (Geelani Faction) Naeem Khan, Tehreek-E-Hurriyat's leader Gazi Javed Baba, and JKLF chairman Farooq Ahmed Dar (Bitta Karate).The investigation traces the terror funding trail. Hurriyat leader Naeem Khan stealthily travels down to Delhi to meet India Today reporters, who posed as potential funders.The investigation revealed that Pakistan's agents who are trying to destabilise Kashmir through street violence are hidden in Delhi.The expose was hailed not only by the government and the BJP but also by the Congress.Also read:India Today impact: NIA roped in to probe Pakistan link in Hurriyat tapes, says Kashmir minister Hurriyat hypocrisy: How children of separatist leaders lead a life of luxury "
3300,Chinese folk medicines inspire new 'molecular condoms',"Los Angeles, May 16 (PTI) Chemicals found in Chinese folk medicines may be used to make next generation of molecular condoms that may serve as a safe alternative to todays hormone-based contraceptives, scientists say. The chemicals, extracted from two plants, thunder god vine and aloe, are effective at low doses and have no adverse effect on egg or sperm, other than preventing a key step in fertilisation - the meeting of egg and sperm. They work by stopping sperms power kick, which is normally stimulated by the hormone progesterone secreted by cells surrounding the egg and makes the sperms tail whip forcefully to propel it toward and into the egg. According to researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley in the US, the chemicals may serve as an emergency contraceptive taken either before or after intercourse, or as a permanent contraceptive via a skin patch or vaginal ring. Human sperm take about five to six hours to mature once they enter the female reproductive system, which is enough time for the drug to enter the system and block the kick. Also, because the chemicals prevent fertilisation, they may be a more acceptable alternative in the eyes of those who object to emergency contraceptives that prevent the implantation of a potentially viable fertilised egg. These two plant compounds block fertilisation at very low concentrations - about 10 times lower than levels of levonorgestrel in emergency contraceptives, said Polina Lishko, an assistant professor at UC Berkeley. ""They could be a new generation of emergency contraceptive we nicknamed molecular condoms,"" said Lishko, who led the team that discovered the anti-fertility properties of the two chemicals. ""If one can use a plant-derived, non-toxic, non-hormonal compound in lesser concentration to prevent fertilisation in the first place, it could potentially be a better option,"" she said. Purusing books on natural contraceptives used by indigenous peoples around the world, researchers came across several non-steroid chemicals isolated from anti-fertility plants. One of these was pristimerin, from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii, also known as ""thunder god vine."" Leaves from the plant have been used as an antifertility drug in Chinese traditional medicine, though some compounds in the leaves are poisonous. It has also been used as a folk remedy for rheumatoid arthritis. The other chemical was lupeol, which is found in plants such as mango and dandelion root. While it has been tested as an anticancer agent, it was not suspected of having contraceptive properties. "
3301,"No-fly rules tilted in favour of airlines, say passengers","New Delhi, May 17 (PTI) Air travellers have voiced concerns over what they call lopsided measures in the no-fly list for unruly passengers and demanded airlines should also be held equally accountable for misbehaviour of their crew. The Ministry of Civil Aviation earlier this month released draft rules on a ""national no-fly list"" for unruly passengers for all domestic carriers. It proposes a flying-ban for a minimum period of three months and a maximum duration which can extend indefinitely. The draft has been placed in the public domain for 30 days inviting comments and feedback from stakeholders. The government will come out with final amendments by June 30. ""There have been a lot of feedback and concern from the public that while there are penal actions recommended against unruly passengers, how will misbehaviour on the part of airlines be dealt with,"" said a senior ministry official. The draft was released on May 5 and comments have been invited until June 4. The ministry has so far received 25 responses from various stakeholders. The official said the governments intention is to have a balance, but added that those who gave feedback felt the draft rules were ""tilted towards airlines"". The proposed no-fly list will compile data on disruptive passengers from all airlines. In case an airline imposes a fly-ban on a passenger, other airlines can independently decide whether to allow him or her. The government has recommended three levels of unruly behaviours- each entailing a corresponding duration for flying ban. The first level of misdemeanor, which includes verbal harassment or physical gesture, carries a flying ban of three months. The second level comprises physically abusive behaviour and will carry a ban of six months. "

3304,Harbhajan asks Kumble for increased fees for Ranji players,"Time away from national team has given Harbhajan Singh a fresh perspective about the condition of an average domestic cricketer, prompting him to request chief national coach Anil Kumble to raise the issue of their match fees with the COA.Kumble is set to give a presentation to the Committee of Administrators (COA) on May 21 about the revised pay structure of the contracted Indian cricketers with an eye on substantial hike on current central contract. The grades are Rs 2 crore, Rs 1 crore and Rs 50 lakh.While the elite Indian cricketers are a sorted lot along with a handful of first-class players, who have IPL contracts, an average domestic cricketer still gets a match fee of Rs 1.5 lakh (first XI player) for a first-class game (Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy) compared to the Rs 15 lakh for a Test match.One of India's finest spinners, Harbhajan has recently written to Kumble about the financial insecurities of domestic cricketers.The letter, accessed by PTI, has Harbhajan making an emotional plea to Kumble.""It's been last 2/3 years (that) I am playing Ranji Trophy. I hate that I've found constant struggle around me in the financial situation of my first-class teammates. Even though Ranji Trophy is hosted by the richest cricket board in the world, I appeal to you as a player, who is an inspiration and role model for all Ranji players,"" Harbhajan wrote to Kumble.""I request you to please take this up with the top brass of BCCI and players like Sachin, Rahul, Laxman, Viru to ensure that a change is brought about in the pay structure, in the amounts they get paid,"" Harbhajan wrote.Harbhajan finds it difficult to digest that the Ranji pay structure has not undergone revision for a long time.""I am willing to help/assist in any way to help bring in a change.

3309,Hyderabad Int'l Airport south India's 1st to go 100% LED-lit,"According to a report, between 2011 and 2012, sales of LED replacement globally increased by 22 per cent and the cost of a 60W equivalent LED bulb fell by nearly 40 per cent. It is believed that by 2030, LEDs will account for 75 per cent of all lighting sales around the world. RAJIV GANDHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTThe Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) at Hyderabad will soon become 100 per cent LED-lit airport. The authorities are already done with 75 per cent work on the project.The GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (GHIAL), which operates the airport, announced on Tuesday that it has converted the entire taxiway edge lights from halogen lamps to LEDs which are highly efficient as compared to halogen lights.LEDs also have a much smaller environmental impact than incandescent bulbs. Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) thus became south India's first and India's second airport to achieve going all LED.HYDERABAD'S CARBON NEUTRAL AIRPORTComplementing the recently achieved recognition of being carbon neutral airport, GHIAL is marching to transform the RGIA into a 100 per cent LED airport, and 75 per cent work on this has already been completed, GHIAL said in a statement.LEDs can also last more than 25 times longer than the traditional light bulbs cutting down costs further.RGIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTENANCEThe RGIA, which currently serves more than 15 million passengers per annum (MPPA) with close to 400 daily air traffic movements, has a mission to move from conventional energy to renewable energy sources for environmental sustenance. It recently commissioned a captive 5MW Solar Power Plant for its use supporting sustainable energy.UNDERGOING LED TRANSFORMATIONThe busiest and the most critical area of the airport -- the airside -- has undergone LED transformation. As many as 500 halogen lamps of taxiway edge lights were converted to LEDs. All LEDs at taxiway edge lights cover around 26 km of the area in the airside.Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport has more than 26,000 conventional lamps. More than 19,500 have been converted into LED.The switch to LED lights has amounted to a saving of 2.2 million unites of electricity per annum."

On a closer look, we discover that these sports celebrities, politicians and authors are just part of a larger virtual wave started by our Minister of Textiles, Smriti Irani. Earlier today, Smriti posted a picture of herself dressed to the T in a saree, saying she depends on cotton to stay cool in the Indian summer, thus giving birth to the trend #CottonIsCool:I celebrate Indian summers and cotton industry with my #CottonIsCool look.

Why must we? Because not only does cotton keep one cool in the summer, it also gives a big boost to Indian handloom and livelihood to weavers.So, we give you four solid reasons to ditch all other fabrics in the cruel Indian summer and wear cotton everyday:1. It keeps you cool in summers and warm in winters: Basically, cotton provides thermal insulation because the fabric traps air between fibres.

The administration that was caught unawares had cleaned up some of the toilets. But many others that were still in poor condition.The minister was clearly upset after spotting tissue papers littered all over the floor of one washroom and started cleaning it himself. He then hauled up SAI administrator Manjushree Roy.Roy tried to control the situation by putting the onus on the Wrestling Federation of India that is hosting the Asian Wrestling Championships at the stadium's KD Jadhav indoor hall. But Goel was not satisfied with her response.The anxiety on Roy's face was palpable as the minister's personal assistant kept taking note of everything and also clicked pictures of the dirty corners.

I have visited almost all the stadiums, except this one. I had come here two-three days ago. Today, everything is clean.

3332,101-yr-old becomes world's oldest skydiver by jumping 15k ft,"A D-day veteran who jumped 15,000ft from a plane has become the oldest person in the world to skydive ? at the age of 101 and 38 days. Bryson William Verdun Hayes, known as Verdun, broke the world record on Sunday, completing a tandem skydive with three generations of his family at an airfield in Honiton, Devon. As he touched down, the former Royal Signals lance corporal said ?hooray? and added that he was feeling ?absolutely over the moon? at completing the challenge.The great-grandfather tried skydiving for the first time when he reached 100, but breaking the British record for the oldest skydiver was not enough for him. Hayes, who said a parachute jump was something he had wanted to do since he turned 90 ? but was talked out of it by his wife, who has since died ? was determined to take the world record and beat its previous holder, Canadian Armand Gendreau who skydived in June 2013 aged 101 and three days. Asked how he was feeling before Sunday?s jump, Hayes replied with a stoic ?all right? and said he was looking forward to the experience. He took to the skies with 10 members of his family at Skydive Buzz in Dunkeswell, all raising money for the Royal British Legion. The youngest skydiver was Stanley, 16, Hayes? great-grandson, while his grandson Roger, 50, son Bryan, 74, and great-granddaughter Ellie, 21, were also among those who took the leap. Ahead of the skydive, his daughter, Lin Tattersall, said: ?He?s made up his own mind that he wants to do it again, and I am extremely proud of the reasoning behind it.? Hayes, from Croyde, Devon, served in the army during the second world war and was presented with a L gion d?honneur for his heroic actions in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and in Normandy, France. He was named Verdun after his father, Joseph Hayes, who served in the first world war as a sapper with the Royal Engineers and who fought during the Battle of the Somme, wrote home to his pregnant wife, Mary, from the frontline suggesting they call their child Verdun after the 1916 battle. Hayes served as a signaller and wireless operator for the Royal Signals during the second world war. He returned to Normandy in 2016 as a beneficiary of the Royal British Legion?s Remembrance Travel arm. During the war, Hayes sustained shrapnel injuries to his ribs and hands in an explosion that killed his friend, Sgt Edgar Robertson. He said: ?How I came home from world war two I do not know. I was so near to the edge of everything. I lost any amount of friends in no time at all really. I just didn?t think I would ever return home.? A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said Hayes would be celebrating with a glass of champagne. He said: ?We are very proud of Verdun?s achievements and his family?s support for the Royal British Legion and the money raised recognises the service and sacrifice made across all generations of the British armed forces. ?The money raised will help support individuals and families from across the generations of our armed forces community.? Members of the family have separate online donation pages but Hayes, who hoped to raise  1,000, has already beaten his target and the current total on Virgin Money Giving stands at more than  1,600."
3333,213 HIV-positive women give birth to healthy babies,"Raipur, May 14 (PTI) At least 213 HIV-infected women have given birth to healthy babies in the government-run hospitals of Chhattisgarh in 2016-17, a state health official has said. ""The health department is committed to secure the child from infection in the womb of a HIV-positive mother,"" Chhattisgarhs health services director R Prasanna told PTI. The multi-medicine treatment process has yielded better results, with 213 HIV-infected women having given birth to healthy babies, he said. In 2016-17, the HIV examination were conducted on as many as 3,93,475 pregnant women and of them, 232 tested positive. Around 219 HIV positive pregnant women were provided treatment under the multi-medicine process at government hospitals, he said. After their deliveries, the babies of 213 women were detected uninfected and healthy, Prasanna said. However, the infection was found in the remaining six children who are being given medicines through the anti- retroviral therapy (ART) centres, he said. ART is the combination of several antiretroviral medicines used to slow the rate at which HIV makes copies of itself (multiplies) in the body. Prasanna said the state has 26,000 HIV positive people and of them, 10,289 were being provided medicines through five ART and 12 link ART centres (which work like sub-centres of ART), according to the set guidelines. Keeping in view the shortage of supply of HIV drugs from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) at New Delhi in January this year, a new guideline was issued by the state, he said. ""The medicines for adults were broken into a standard dose to feed the children. All the ART and link ART centres had followed the directive. ""Neither the child patients, nor their parents had to face trouble (during shortage of medicines),"" he said. As per the new guidelines of NACO, it is mandatory for all the HIV patients to take medicines of ART. For the purpose, the state recently received as many as 2.54 lakh medicines (of different compositions) from the Central government for its ART centres, the director said. "

3335,"When was last time India, Pak faced off at UN court ICJ?","The International Court of Justice (ICJ) was last a battleground for India and Pakistan nearly 18 years ago when Islamabad sought its intervention over the shooting down of its naval aircraft.Tomorrow, the ICJ, which is the U.N.'s principal judicial organ, is holding a public hearing at the Great Hall of Justice housed in the Peace Palace at The Hague in Netherlands where the two countries will be asked to present their case over the contentious Jadhav issue.India on May 8 moved a petition before the U.N. body to seek justice for Kulbhushan Jadhav, 46, alleging violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by Pakistan after its 16 requests for consular access to the former naval officer was consistently denied.A Pakistani military court awarded death sentence to Jadhav last month for alleged espionage and subversive activities. Pakistan has also not responded to the request for visas applied by Jadhav's family. Jadhav was arrested on March 3 last year.PREVIOUS CASE FOUGHTThe previous case was related to shooting down of Pakistan's maritime reconnaissance aircraft Atlantique by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the Kutch region on August 10, 1999, killing all 16 naval personnel on board. Pakistan claimed the plane was brought down in its air space and sought 60 million USD in damages from India for the incident.A 16-judge bench of the court on June 21, 2000 voted 14-2 to dismiss Pakistan's claim. The decision was announced by bench president Gilbert Guillaume of France at a public sitting. The verdict was final and there was no appeal.The ICJ found that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by Pakistan on September 21, 1999.Public hearings in the case titled 'Aerial incident of August 10, 1999 (Pakistan vs India)' lasted four days ending April 6, 2000. Arguments centred on the court's jurisdiction in the case which had to be determined before its merits could be considered by the 16 judges.MORE ABOUT THE ATLANTIQUE CASEThe Atlantique case was ousted by the ICJ on the issue of jurisdiction and not on merits. Both parties had agreed that the question of jurisdiction would be decided first and only then would the issue of merits be taken up.Guillaume said the court would first have to decide whether it had the jurisdiction to go into the case as contended by New Delhi after the Indian delegation led by the then Attorney General Soli Sorabjee, raised preliminary objections to its jurisdiction.Pakistan opened the first round of oral arguments, India replying them, and then Pakistan following with its second round, with India making its response thereto.INDIA'S ARGUMENTSIndia argued that the court did not have jurisdiction in the matter, citing an exemption it had filed way back in 1974 to exclude disputes between India and other Commonwealth states, and disputes covered by multilateral treaties.Sorabjee told the court that Pakistan was 'solely responsible' for the incident and Islamabad must 'bear the consequences of its own acts.'Pakistan's Attorney General Aziz Munshi had sought a speedy resolution, saying its application had to be concluded quickly so that it did not remain an irritant in Indo-Pak relations.Pakistan had also sought to politicise the case by referring to the Kashmir issue, the Kargil conflict, Indo-Pak relations and alleged motives for the shooting.PAKISTAN'S ARGUMENTSPakistan wanted the court to intervene while India was opposed to its assumption of jurisdiction on the basis of Islamabad's application.It urged the court to ""dismiss the objections raised by India and accept its jurisdiction."" India maintained that none of Pakistan's arguments is 'sound' and does not provide a basis for invoking the court's jurisdiction.Sorabjee expressed happiness with the court's verdict.""We are very happy. The court has accepted all our contentions,"" he had said.Former supreme court judge B P Jeevan Reddy and Pakistan's former Attorney General Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada were co-opted into the bench as ad-hoc judges.ICJ RULES ON JUDGESAs per ICJ rules, when it does not include a judge possessing the nationality of the state party to a case, the state may appoint a person to sit as a judge ad-hoc for the purpose of the case.The court also recalled that its lack of jurisdiction does not relieve States of their obligation to settle their disputes by peaceful means.The choice of those means admittedly rests with the parties under Article 33 of the UN Charter, it said, adding, they are nonetheless under an obligation to seek such a settlement, and to do so in good faith in accordance with the Charter.As regards India and Pakistan, that obligation was restated more particularly in the Simla Accord of July 2, 1972. Moreover, the Lahore Declaration of 21 February, 1999 reiterated ""the determination of both countries to implementing the Simla Agreement,"" it said.SETTLE DISPUTES BY PEACEFUL MEANSAccordingly, the court reminded the parties of their obligation to settle their disputes by peaceful means, and in particular the dispute arising out of the Atlantique incident in conformity with the obligations which they have undertaken.India's External Affairs Ministry while hailing the verdict especially welcomed the court's positive observations on the principles enunciated in the Simla agreement and Lahore Declaration as the basis for an Indo-Pak rapprochement.Through its comments, the court has vindicated India's stand on these landmark agreements that are the very cornerstone of India-Pakistan relations, a ministry spokesman had said.Also Read:Kulbhushan Jadhav death sentence: Pakistan to overrule International Court of Justice's order"
3336,Relative may sue Johar for false claims in biography: Report,"Karan Johar's autobiography An Unsuitable Boy became a runaway bestseller within hours of hitting the stands. The book released earlier this year and the candid confessions in it by Karan Johar charmed readers and critics all across the country.However, as it turns out, Karan Johar may have lied about his family members in the book. According to a report in Indian Express, what Karan Johar has written about his father's family may be fiction and not fact.In An Unsuitable Boy, Karan Johar has written that on his father's side, his relatives were halwais (sweet-makers). He added that his father was the only family member who was somewhat educated and could speak in English which is why he got to sit at the sales counter. Shortly after, his father quit the job.The report says that in actuality, Karan Johar's grandfather was a government employee based in Lahore before starting a sweet shop in Delhi. Karan Johar's eldest uncle, Ved Prakash Johar, was a graduate of Lahore's Government College and was pally with the poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Ved later got a journalism degree from Columbia University in New York and joined the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). One of his other uncles was with the Indian Army and another aunt, college-educated, was a teacher.Apparently, only one uncle of Karan Johar was a halwai and he ran a sweet shop and restaurant called Nanking in Delhi's Connaught Place."

3341,Indian-origin doctor had warned against global ransomware,"(Eds: Updating with additional inputs) From Aditi Khanna London, May 13 (PTI) An Indian-origin doctor based in London had warned against the cyber-hack of the UKs state-run National Health Service just days before it crippled the countrys network. Krishna Chinthapalli, a neurology registrar at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, had said an increasing number of hospitals could be shut down by ransomeware attacks in an article on the vulnerability of the NHS network in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, two days before the major cyber hack of the National Health Service (NHS) system on Friday. He had highlighted an incident at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge where a nurse clicked on a malicious link and malware infected her computer and started to encrypt sensitive files. ""Fortunately, the hospitals daily data backup had just been completed. The IT director admitted that they were very lucky, saying, Timing absolutely was everything for us,"" Chinthapalli wrote. ""We should be prepared: more hospitals will almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year,"" he wrote. The revelation came as UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed today that as many as 48 NHS trusts had been affected by the large-scale cyber-hack by an international criminal gang wreaked havoc around the country. After chairing an emergency meeting of the COBRA committee, Rudd said that all but 6 trusts were now back to normal. Confirming that 97 per cent of hospitals were ""back to normal"", she said, ""This is a virus that attacked Windows platforms. The fact is the NHS has fallen victim to this."" The Opposition Liberal Democrat and Labour parties have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack. Patients of the state-funded country-wide service are still facing days of chaos as appointments and surgeries were cancelled after NHS organisations from London to Scotland were hit in the ""ransomware"" attack yesterday. NHS Digital said the impact of the cyberattack could continue. ""The situation is changing and impacting organisations in a range of different ways,"" a spokesperson said. Ciaran Martin, who leads the UKs National Cyber Security Centre, said his team was doing everything in their power to get ""vital services"" back up and running. ""We are very aware that attacks on critical services such as the NHS have a massive impact on individuals and their families, and we are doing everything in our power to help them restore these vital services,"" he said. ""Its important to understand that cyber attacks can be different from other forms of crime in that their sometimes highly technical and anonymous nature means it can take some time to understand how it worked, who was behind it and what the impact is,"" he told the BBC. Critically ill patients are being diverted to unaffected hospitals as computer systems failed in A&E units and doctors were locked out of test results, X-rays and patient records. NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment should go to Accidents & Emergency (A&E) or access emergency services as they normally would. However, there have been some reports of ambulances being diverted from affected hospitals and individual NHS trusts have asked registered patients not to attend unless it is urgent. Londons Barts Health NHS Trust, the largest trust in the UK, cancelled all outpatient appointments at its five hospitals today. The NHS has not been affected in Wales and Northern Ireland. The assault is part of an attack that has affected organisations in more than 70 countries, including the United States, China, Russia and Spain, disrupting power and telephone companies. Gangs are thought to have used tools stolen from US spies and dumped online by hackers linked to Russia. ""This is not targeted at the NHS, its an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said. ""The National Cyber Security Centre is working closely with NHS Digital to ensure they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety. We are not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised,"" she said. The attack came after warnings of NHS vulnerability, with cybersecurity allegedly neglected despite a series of attempted hacks. Ransomware programmes, which are sent by email and spread swiftly, can be bought on the dark web with sellers negotiating a percentage of the takings. ""We will be advising NHS trusts to modernise their platforms,"" UK home secretary Amber Rudd said. The malware used in the NHS attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems. It encrypts files on a users computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again. The demand is for a payment of 300 dollars in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files. "
3342,India's longest bridge to be inaugurated on May 26 by PM Modi,"India's longest river bridge, capable of withstanding the weight of a 60-tonne battle tank, will be inaugurated in Assam close to the border with China on May 26 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.With the inauguration of the 9.15-km-long Dhola-Sadiya bridge over the Brahmaputra river, the prime minister will kick start the celebrations of the NDA government's three years in office from this eastern-most part of Assam.The bridge is seen as an attempt by India to shore up its defence requirements along the Sino-Indian border particularly in the Northeast besides providing easy access to the people of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam with air and rail connectivity.It is 3.55 km longer than the Bandra-Worli sea link in Mumbai, making it the longest bridge in India.""The prime minister will dedicate the strategically important bridge to the nation on May 26. It will bolster the road connectivity in the Northeast as the bridge will be used by people of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh besides defence forces extensively,"" Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told PTI.BRIDGE CAN WITHSTAND MOVEMENT OF MILITARY TANKSThe construction of the bridge began in 2011 at a project cost of Rs 950 crore. The design is such that the bridge can withstand the movement of military tanks.""Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have huge strategic value to the country. Since the bridge is located close to our border with China, it will help quick movement of military troops and artillery in times of conflict,"" Sonowal said.The bridge is located 540-km away from Assam capital Dispur and 300 km away from Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar. The aerial distance to the Chinese border is less than 100 km.After Kaliabhomora bridge near Tezpur, there is no bridge over the Brahmaputra for the next 375 km upstream till Dhola, where the new bridge is constructed. Currently, all the transport between the two banks of the river are being carried out through water only.BRIDGE TO CUT DOWN TRAVEL TIMEThe bridge, when opened for the public, will cut down the travel time between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh by as much as four hours.As there is no civilian airport in Arunachal Pradesh, this bridge will help people of the state to reach the nearest rail head in Tinsukia and the airport in Dibrugarh easily.Sonowal said the delayed works of the bridge was expedited after Modi assumed the charge in 2014. The bridge was originally scheduled to open in 2015.The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Assam will complete one year in office on May 24.The bridge is one of the key projects of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in the Northeast and is built in public-private partnership with a construction company.

3344,India's only existing steam engine put on display in Haryana,"A shiny, sleek white steam engine huffing and puffing away, much like us in this stifling heat, is an unusual sight in the middle of nowhere, just beyond Bilaspur in Haryana. Located at the Heritage Transport Museum, India's only transport museum, the steam engine was unveiled at the museum on Saturday.Home to about 2,500 curated vintage cars, buses, trains and pre-mechanised modes of transportation like bullock carts and even boats and an aviation gallery, the museum is the brainchild of Tarun Thakral, founder and managing trustee, and traces the evolution of modes of transport in India.""There aren't any steam engines operational because it's quite expensive. Even the toy trains work on diesel or battery. So, the younger genera-tion has no idea what a steam engine looks like or functions. This is an opportunity for them to see the same,"" says Tarun. The 12.5-ft tall and 31-ft long engine moved back and forth on the relatively small track, using wood to obtain the steam. The engine, originally built in 1953 by a German locomotive manufacturer, has been restored from its dilapidated condition in which it was found in Bihar. ""It took three months to restore it, while permissions and talks with the Indian Railways to acquire it took about three years. We are using wood here because coal quality is not good,"" says Tarun. This steam engine will be operational on special occasio-ns and one can also pay and get the engine moving, in case anyone wants a private experience.The museum, which opened in December 2013, after Tarun fell in love with cars.

Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, Kapil Mishra asked Arvind Kejriwal to quit as Delhi Chief Minister else he will ""drag him by the collar and take him to Tihar jail"".

3346,63% Indians concerned about leakage of data given to Aadhaar,"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea challenging various notifications of the Centre to make Aadhaar mandatory for availing benefits of government schemes.The matter has been listed in the apex court for hearing on May 17. A five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar will hear the plea. The same bench is currently hearing a batch of petitions challenging the practice of triple talaq.But, ahead of Supreme Court's hearing, about 63 per cent people have expressed concern about the leakage of their Aadhaar data.MAJORITY CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACYIn a survey conducted by the LocalCircles - a citizen engagement platform - about 63 per cent of over 10,700 participants said that they were concerned about the leakage of their personal data given to Aadhaar into public domain.In a statement, the LocalCircles said that ""details of 13.5 crore Aadhaar accounts were published on a website highlighting vulnerabilities of the system. Also, Aadhaar of students of some Kendriya Vidyalaya schools were found on their websites.""This raises the question of misuse of personal data by people or groups with vested interests. According to the survey, many participants questioned the security mechanism of the regulatory body of Aadhaar - the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). WHERE IS THE PROBLEM?The LocalCircles release said, ""Some citizens outlined that vendors who make Aadhaar card have been selling information in the market.""On the other hand, the vendors enlisted their own problems in providing service to the people in accordance with the rules laid down by the UIDAI. The vendors, the release said, ""outlined various concerns including the costs that they incur to become a licensed Aadhaar operator, the high upfront equipment cost and the fact that the UIDAI payment of INR 100 per Aadhaar is usually quite delayed. Therefore it is not lucrative for them to be an operator unless they charge extra from citizens for making Aadhaar or find other ways to earn."" However, 70 per cent of the participants of the survey extended their support to the government's emphasis on Aadhaar making it mandatory for filing tax returns and linking it to Permanent Account Number (PAN).Approximately 70 per cent citizens support this move of the government while 27 per cent were against the idea. ALL EYES ON SUPREME COURTThe Supreme Court has repeatedly directed the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory for welfare schemes. First such ruling came in October 2015. But, the apex court later amended its order saying that there was nothing wrong if government made the Aadhaar mandatory for income tax filing or linking with PAN.Now, former chairperson of National Commission For Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) Shanta Sinha has filed a petition challenging various notifications of the government with regard to Aadhaar. Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Shanta Sinha said, ""Despite the order of this court that Aadhaar will be voluntary and not mandatory, the government has been coming out with a series of notifications making it mandatory to avail benefits of schemes like scholarships, Right to Food and mid-day meal in schools."""

Every Indian must experience this story and even globally...he was hesitant because we all know how private he is.So at first I didn't tell him that he has to act. But having seen everything real on the field, we wanted to see the real Sachin not an actor Sachin. That's what we have done. We have picked up situations from his life over the past 24 years and put him on those situations again and shot in real time. We have archived around 10,000 hours of footage and from that we have made a film of two hours "" he said."

On Friday, the Imam of Kolkata's Tipu Sultan mosque reiterated that he will continue with a red beacon on his vehicle despite the central government ban on its use. When India Today questioned him on the illegal use of the beacon, an angry Barkati retorted asking, ""Why are you so concerned about my red beacon?""""No one has the guts to remove my red beacon. It's been with us for hundreds of years. It is the RSS which is illegal, Modi is illegal not the red light on my car. Don't try disturbing Muslims in Bengal,"" the controversial cleric told India Today. His response comes just a day after multiple police complaints were filed against him for illegally using the red beacon and making hate speeches. Complaints have been filed at Topsia and Gariahat police stations in Kolkata and Golabari station in Howrah district by various individuals.""Earlier he had issued a fatwa against the prime minister. Even today he has said that there is nobody who can remove his red beacon.

Does anyone has guts (to arrest me)...I'm not scared,"" he hit back.On Friday BJP Yuva Morcha supporters demonstrated in central Kolkata demanding Barkati's immediate arrest, accusing the cleric of making anti-India statements. Similar protest were held in Howrah with BJP supporters burning his effigy. ""If this kind of treatment is being meted out to me, then think of what will happen to the Muslims across the country?

His speech was witty, insightful and wise as always and one of the highlights of the twenty-minute long speech-a-thon was Shah Rukh Khan talking about his reaction to a rather idiotic rumour about him, his family and his youngest child, AbRam.Shah Rukh Khan began speaking about speculations and rumours about his life as a superstar and apparently, one of the rumours was that AbRam was the love child of SRK's eldest son Aryan Khan!Shah Rukh Khan spoke, ""Four years ago, my lovely wife Gauri and me decided to have a third child.

3356,Air India Chairman asks staff to carry their own luggage,"In the last few months, India?s pervasive culture of privilege has got a sound beating: In March, Ravindra Gaikwad, an MP, hit a 60-year-old Air India (AI) employee with a slipper and soon found himself on a ?no-fly? list. Then in April, the Cabinet banned red beacons on cars. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that there are no VIPs, every Indian is a very important person.On Wednesday, Air India (AI) scrapped one more privilege, this time an in-house one. Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani asked the staff to carry their hand baggage on their own and not use porters as has been the practice so far. Air India has a subsidiary called AI-SATS, a ground handling agency, which provides end-to-end services such as passenger and baggage handling. Apart from this, some people are reserved to assist VIPs and airline staff. They are called porters and carry the luggage of the ?VIP? passenger from the entry gate to the boarding point. But now only VIPs will continue to use the services of porters, the airline staff will be discouraged to use it. ?Even CMD will not use the porter service,? the airline said.While the move appreciable, the change is cosmetic. The move would have got a higher rating if this privilege was taken away from VIPs too. While such changes are fine and make for good optics, there are so many things that the AI needs to fix and, hopefully, those will also get adequate attention. Take for example, the airline?s rating and public perception. In January, flight data firm FlightStats marked AI as the third worst-performing airline in the world. The Portland-headquartered firm?s survey highlighted issues over cabins, service quality, and flight delays. Though Air India disagreed with the report, such reports do impact public perception and eventually bookings. It is important to manage perceptions and AI has to invest time, effort and money into it apart from doing away with perks and privileges extended to staff.  Then its finances. As a columnist pointed out last week, the organisation has consistently incurred losses and is severely debt-ridden despite equity infusion of around Rs 25,000 crore since 2012. More damaging was the Comptroller and Auditor General?s performance audit report of the airline, which was tabled in Parliament in March. The report said inefficiencies in the company may mean that a lot more of public money will be needed to keep the Maharaja afloat.  "

3360,Topic is redundant: Madhuri on rumoured ex-boyfriend Dutt ,"It is a known fact that Madhuri Dixit was dating Sanjay Dutt back in the early 90s. But as soon as Dutt was arrested in 1993 Bombay blasts, Madhuri started to maintain her distance, and as they say, rest is history. But decades later, filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani has decided to bring Sanju baba's life on 70mm. And if reports are to be believed, Madhuri's existence in his life has been carefully cropped in the biopic. There were rumours a few months ago that Dhak Dhak girl had requested Hirani to chop off her part. However, in an interview to Mid-Day, Madhuri rubbished the rumours and said, ""For where I am today, this [the topic of Dutt] has become redundant. Life has come a long way since then. I don't know where these reports are coming from. In any case, it doesn't make a difference to me.""There were reports that Karisma Tanna was supposed to essay the role of Madhuri in the biopic. However, it was later revealed that Sonam Kapoor's character will be an amalgamation of Dutt's love interests in the early 90s. Ranbir Kapoor has stepped into the shoes of Sanjay Dutt for the biopic. Tentatively titled Dutt, the film will focus on Sanjay's formative years, his relation with his father Sunil Dutt, his struggles coping up with the loss of his mother, his many affairs, etc.  "
3361,"AAP's Somnath Bharti used to beat, harass wife: Police to HC","New Delhi, May 12 (PTI) In a big jolt to controversial AAP leader Somnath Bharti who is facing a domestic violence case, the police today told the Delhi High Court that a medical report has opined that the scars on his wifes body were ""due to dog bites and burn injuries"". The investigators also alleged before Justice I S Mehta that Bharti, former Law Minister, used to harass and beat his wife Lipika Mitra, who has sought cancellation of his bail in a domestic violence case lodged by her. The MLA, who was granted bail on October 7, 2015 after being in jail for eight days, has denied the allegations levelled against him by his wife. His counsel today told the court that they would like to file a rejoinder. The police, which has filed its affidavit following the courts direction, also submitted in the court orally that an ""AIIMS medical board has opined that the scars on the womans body were due to dog bites and burn injuries"". The investigators had on April 5 last year filed the charge sheet in the case, mentioning that the woman had made an allegation that Bharti had endangered the life of an unborn child which she was carrying by unleashing his dog on her. The police said ""the AIIMS medical board had examined six photos, which are concerned with the treatment history of dog bite, prescribed by Ayushman hospital (in Dwarka) here. ""We are also of the opinion that the scar marks could be due to consequences of dog bite injuries,"" the police said in its affidavit. It also claimed that some of the injury marks were ""due to burns."" In its affidavit, the police said ""Somnath Bharti used to harass, beat and abuse the petitioner (wife) from the very beginning of the marriage, despite having knowledge about her frail health conditions. ""The medical record produced by the petitioner (wife) was examined and verified and it shows that she was suffering from diabetes and hypertension at the time of pregnancy."" It claimed there was sufficient evidence on record for alleged offences for attempt to murder, act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth, causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means against the MLA from Malviya Nagar assembly. Further, the police said there was a case of alleged dowry harassment and criminal breach of trust alongwith the charge of cheating and criminal intimidation against him under the Indian Penal Code. Lipika had moved the high court challenging the bail order, saying it was almost like a verdict and the trial court had relied on the case diary which allegedly should not have been done at that stage. Bhartis wife had on June 10, 2015 lodged a complaint against him with the Delhi Commission for Women and an FIR was lodged by the Delhi Police on September 9, 2015 for allegedly subjecting her to domestic violence and trying to kill her. The AAP leader was arrested in the wee hours of September 29, 2015 after the Supreme Court had ordered him to surrender but was granted bail on October 7, 2015. Police also informed the court that it has filed a charge sheet in the matter before the trial court, which has taken cognisance of the matter and posted it for hearing on May 20. Taking on record the affidavit filed by the police, the high court then posted the matter for hearing on October 24. The womans counsel Rahul Kumar urged the court to list the matter for early hearing saying it has already been delayed for over one year. "

The educational module has a target audience of class 8th to 12th and is also expected to expand to anganwadis in Haryana.The module will include educating students on sex education, nutrition demands of a body during adolescence, sex and reproductive health, gender violence, substance abuse.The team members constituting representatives of state health department, WCD department and education department highlight that in some schools in Haryana, female students are attended only by male teachers, which adds to hesitation around the conversation on sex education.FOCUS ON ABOLISHING STIGMA AROUND SEXAiming to establish a progressive discourse, team members and teachers are being trained to sensitise students on how the attraction to opposite sex is a very natural phenomenon.

3369,"Airtel, Idea, Vodafone to be probed for blocking Jio's entry","New Delhi, May 11 (PTI) The Competition Commission has ordered a detailed probe against major telecom players for allegedly trying to block the entry of newcomer Reliance Jio, according to sources. The fair trade regulators decision comes on a complaint filed against leading incumbent players -- Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular -- and industry body COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India). A senior official said the regulator has decided to investigate allegations of unfair business practices made against the incumbent telecom players. Sources said the regulator would also examine the overall conduct of the COAI, especially since the allegations of anti- competitive practices have been made against three of its key members. The probe by the Director General (DG) has been ordered for allegedly trying to restrict the entry of Reliance Jio, the official added. DG is the investigation arm of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Cases where the watchdog finds prima-facie evidence of competition norms violations are referred to the DG for detailed probe. When contacted for comments on the CCI ordering the probe, an Airtel spokesperson said, ""We have not received any such communication from the CCI and would, therefore, not be able to comment."" ""We have already stated that we have always responded with alacrity and provided a staggering quantum of PoIs (Point of Interconnections) to Reliance Jio in record time,"" the spokesperson added. Emails sent to Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Jio did not elicit any response. ""Though we have not seen the order as it has not been published yet, we are disappointed at the apparent news (if confirmed), that the CCI has decided to go forward with an investigation into the complaint filed by Reliance Jio,"" COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said. ""We believe the COAI and its members will be fully vindicated in the matter and truth will prevail,"" he said. Last year, billionaire Mukesh Ambanis venture Reliance Jio stormed into the Indian telecom market - the second largest market globally with 1.2 billion subscribers - with disruptive offerings and has since been at loggerheads with the incumbent operators. Reliance Jio had accused incumbent players of not providing sufficient network connectivity (leading to call failures on its network) while the latter countered the claims saying the newcomer was unleashing ""tsunami"" of free traffic from its mobile network. The two sides have also clashed on other contentious issues like free voice and data offers, and customised retention plans. "
3370,J&K soldiers to inform units in Valley before going home,"Taking lesson from the killing of the 22-year-old Army officer Lieutenant Ummer Fayaz in Shopian, the Indian Army has directed all soldiers to strictly follow guidelines of informing the local units before going home on leave in the Valley.  Sources in the security establishment said that there is a guideline which local officers or soldiers need to follow in the Valley. As per the guidelines, the Army unit in the area is informed well in advance about officers going on leave if he is from Kashmir.

Since Fayaz's brutal killing has come as a shock to the Army and the nation, it is expected that the soldiers and officers strictly follow the guidelines. "
3371,Pak-based terrorists plan to attack India: US Intelligence,"spymaster                               From Lalit K Jha                Washington, May 12 (PTI) Pakistan-based terrorist groups are planning to attack both India and Afghanistan, a top US spymaster has said. ""Islamabad has failed to curb militants and terrorists in Pakistan,"" Daniel Coats, Director of National Intelligence told members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence during a Congressional hearing on Worldwide threats. ""These groups will present a sustained threat to the United Statess interest in the region and continue to plan and conduct attacks in India and Afghanistan,"" Coats said. Pakistan, he rued, is expanding its nuclear arsenal in pursuing tactical nuclear weapons, potentially lowering the threshold for their use. In South Asia, the intelligence community assesses that the political and security situation in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through 2018 even with a modest increase in military assistance by the United States and its partners, he told the lawmakers. ""This deterioration is undermined by its dire economic situation. Afghanistan will struggle to curb its dependence on external support until it contains the insurgency or reaches a peace agreement with the Taliban,"" he said. "

Sanders said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has strong bipartisan support and is ""independent enough"" to carry out the investigation. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump yesterday met Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe to discuss the situation and morale at the agency after the firing of the James Comey a day earlier. The White House also issued a timeline claiming how Trump lost confidence in Comey over the course of the last several months.

3374,How has SC dealt with issue of personal laws in the past?,"Triple talaq case, originative from the petition filed by Shayara Bano in a case of divorce from her husband, is not the first matter relating to personal laws before the Supreme Court. The apex court has dealt with several such cases before but surprisingly it has not given a consistent interpretation of the laws and provisions of Constitution. The conflict arises when personal laws are perceived to be in violation of the fundamental rights.Article 13 of the Constitution states that any law, which goes against the provisions of fundamental rights, shall be void to the extent of contravention.SUPREME COURT'S STAND ON PERSONAL LAWSPersonal laws in India are codified and uncodified - existing in custom and practice. Over the years, the Supreme Court has taken differing views on the question of precedence of personal laws over the fundamental rights. In Krishna Singh vs Mathura Ahir case of 1980, Maharshi Avdesh case of 1994 and Ahmedabad Women Action Group case of 1997, the Supreme Court held that personal laws could not be challenged for being in contravention of the provisions of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.Many believe that this interpretation of the Supreme Court has been based on a ruling of the Bombay High Court in Narsu Appa Mali case of 1951. In this case, the Bombay High Court has enunciated that personal laws are not 'laws' under Article 13 of the Constitution.But, a three-Judge Supreme Court bench in Mudaliar case of 1996 held that personal laws are void to the extent that they are in violation of the fundamental rights.All these aspects and arguments are likely to be placed and reexamined the Supreme Court during the seven-day hearing of the triple talaq matter this summer.SOME RECENT CASES OF PERSONAL LAWS: SHAH BANO MATTERThe most famous case relating to personal laws was that of Shah Bano, who had fought long drawn legal battle seeking maintenance from her ex-husband. In 1985, the Supreme Court had directed Shah Bano's husband to pay her alimony according to the laws applicable to other Indians.The Supreme Court had rejected the argument of Shah Bano's ex-husband that since she was paid during the period of iddat - the waiting period after divorce and also the amount of mehr, she was not entitled to any further maintenance under the Muslim personal law.MARY ROY CASEThe very next year, the Supreme Court decided another case relating to Christian personal law in the 1986-case of Mary Roy. The Supreme Court ruled that Syrian Christian women were entitled to equal share in their father's property.Before the Supreme Court order, the Syrian Christian community settled property inheritance issue as per the Travancore Succession Act, 1916 and Cochin Succession Act, 1921 while other Christians followed the Indian Succession Act of 1925 for the same. As per the Travancore and Cochin Acts, women received only a quarter of their male siblings or Rs 5,000 whichever was less.DANIAL LATIFI CASEDanial Latifi was the lawyer of Shah Bano, who has won a maintenance case against her ex-husband in the Supreme Court. But, the apex court verdict was not received well by the conservative segment of Muslim society.In order to pacify the swelling sentiment of the community, the then Rajiv Gandhi government enacted the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986. The new Act overturned the judgment of the Supreme Court providing that a man was required to pay maintenance to his divorced wife only during the period of Iddat.Danial Latifi challenged the constitutional validity of the Personal law. The Supreme Court, in 2001 during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, held that the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986 did not violate the Constitution or the fundamental rights.The Supreme Court maintained that the personal laws need not be tested on the touchstone of the provisions of the fundamental rights.TRIPLE TALAQ CASE IN BOMBAY HIGH COURTIn another case of triple talaq, the Bombay High Court held in 2002 that if wife contests this practice of divorce, it needed to be proved in a court of law. In its 88-page judgment, the Bombay High Court ruled that ""divorces between Muslims couples will now have to be convincingly proved under Civil Procedure Act and Indian Evidence Act. A mere statement, written or oral, by a Muslim man seeking divorce will not be enough proof of his having obtained the divorce.""The Bombay High Court also held that a Muslim man did not have a unilateral right to divorce his wife by triple talaq. The man is bound to provide good reasons for a divorce.ADOPTION BY MUSLIM WOMENThe Supreme Court again delivered a landmark judgment in 2014 on the question of adoption of child by a Muslim woman. The Muslim personal law does not give women of the community the right to adopt children.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam ruled that Muslim women had the right to legally adopt children like any other Indian citizen. The Supreme Court held that the right to adopt children could not be denied by Muslim personal law.RIGHT OF UNWED MOTHERUnder the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 father was held as the natural guardian of a Hindu child. If a child was born out of wedlock, only then the mother could be considered a natural guardian.But, in 2015, the Supreme Court held that an unwed mother can legally become the sole guardian of a child. The apex court held the consent of the biological father is not necessary for the mother to become legal guardian of the child.The Supreme Court observed that the father could not have 'a preferential right over the mother in the matter of guardianship'.ALSO READ |Triple talaq: Supreme Court begins hearing on whether it is fundamental to Islam"
3375,I-T notice to AAP over alleged tampering of donation records,"(Eds: Adding AAPs reaction) New Delhi, May 9 (PTI) The Income Tax department today issued a notice to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) asking why it should not be prosecuted for alleged falsification of account books and ""wilful attempt"" to evade tax on donations received by it. The department has issued the show cause notice to the partys convenor - Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal- and three others and has sought the partys reply in this regard by first half of this month. The tax department has charged the party with not filing a ""true and correct"" contribution report for donations received for the assessment year 2014-15 which have been found to be over Rs 30.08 crore after year long investigations. The taxman said the first audit report filed by the party to it and the Election Commission, under the provisions of the Representation of People Act, were ""incorrect and fabricated"". The notice said that in view of these charges, the department seeks to file a prosecution complaint (charge sheet) under I-T laws in a court under sections 277A (false statement in verification) and 276C (wilful attempt to evade tax). A maximum of three years rigorous imprisonment and a fine can be levied on an accused once the charges are proved in court. It said that the exemption enjoyed by the Kejriwal-led AAP from paying income tax on donations could also be withdrawn as these privileges have been ""wrongly claimed"". Political parties enjoy tax exemption under section 13A of the Income Tax Act. The notice while acknowledging that the party had accepted that there were ""certain errors"" in its first report filed in this regard, added that this admission by the AAP was itself an evidence that its audit report was fabricated initially but was corrected after the taxman began investigations of its audit books and accounts.

3379,"Who is Shayara Bano, woman behind triple talaq case in SC?","When an under-confident, middle-class woman from a small town showed the courage to demand the scrapping of unilateral pronouncement of divorce in one sitting (triple talaq) people took note.Not only because she was an unlikely candidate to have challenged a religious practice but also because many were keen to know whether she can eventually force a change despite the opposition.THE STORY OF SHAIRA37- year-old Shaira Bano has taken her triple talaq case to the Supreme Court and citing it as an 'unfair practice' she has demanded it be abolished in India. She says she was duped into accepting a post that summarily broke her home. A marriage of 15 years was dissolved in minutes unilaterally with her husband dispatching a 'talaqnama' to her while she was at her parent's place in Kashipur, Uttarakhand recuperating from an illness. Shaira recounts, ""I spoke to him over the phone last year where he said he had left me. Then one day he said he was sending some property papers and that I must accept the post. I did. And when I opened it, there lay before me a divorce deed (talaqnama).""Shaira alleges she went through a harrowing time in the last 15 years of marriage. She was mentally tortured by demands of dowry initially. After she had two children, all subsequent pregnancies were forcefully aborted by her husband. Despite all this, she never protested, just so that she could save her home and not bring disrepute to her family.'KHULA' DIVORCEWhen I asked her mother about why she let her daughter suffer and not demand a 'khula', a divorce initiated by a woman, her mother claimed she were unaware of her daughter's plight. Shaira's mother, Firoza Bano, however later confessed that the family wanted to save the marriage from breaking somehow as they feared disrepute. She said, ""Since day one he (Shaira's husband) would say I will seek talaq but we are simple people and wanted our daughter to remain settled in the marriage.""Though Shaira has an MA in Sociology she has never worked. She was always financially dependent on her husband, who offered her a paltry 'meher' amount of about 16,000 rupees at the time of talaq. It is this 'unfairness' she says she has challenged but with this she has taken on those who refuse to entertain any thought of change to the Muslim personal laws. FIGHT AGAINST TRADITIONSHer brother Arshad told us ""The Muslim Personal Law Board has filed a petition against us saying we are going against the rules of Islam and they will not allow any change.""Member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Kamal Farooqi told us that the Board has filed a rejoinder to Shaira's petition. According to him, ""Personal laws cannot be tampered with or changed for one case alone. Today they will want to change talaq laws, tomorrow they will intrude into other aspects like inheritance. This is unacceptable.""The AIMPLB is not alone in its opposition. No political party is willing to push for changes in personal laws. So much so that even the BJP that has been vocal on uniform civil code skirted the issue. Minority affairs minister Nejma Heptullah said that a ""demand for change should come from within the community."" The JD(U), Congress, Samajwadi party all voiced a similar opinion.However, Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate KTS Tulsi took a different stand, ""Why can't the judiciary decide on something that is related to human right? Most Muslim countries have also done away with triple talaq, why can't we?"""
3380,Malaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan's divorce finalised,"Malaika Arora and Arbaaz Khan have finally ended their 18-year marriage. The legal proceedings are all over, and the Bandra family court today granted Malaika and Arbaaz a divorce.It was last November that Malaika and Arbaaz filed for a divorce by mutual consent. Over the last six months, the two actors have been spotted together on numerous occasions. Even yesterday, Malaika and Arbaaz were together along with their son Arhaan at Justin Bieber's concert at the DY Patil stadium in Mumbai. The two went to the court too today in the same car.While Malaika has got custody of the couple's son Arhaan, Arbaaz has been granted visitation rights whenever he wants, says a report in Mid-Day. The ex-couple's lawyers Kranti Sathe and Amruta Sathe Pathak confirmed the news to the tabloid.Last year, after months of rumours that Malaika and Arbaaz's marriage was over, the two finally released an official statement declaring the same.In their joint statement, Malaika and Arbaaz said, ""The truth is, we have taken a break, but that doesn't mean people can presume, assume and speculate things of such malicious nature. We are taking out time to figure out our lives... Yes, it's true that we are separated, but where our lives go and what transpires between us, it is for us to decide. Wherever it goes from here, we will talk about it when we are ready to.""""We have got a child and our families are involved, but just because we have not said anything till now, it doesn't give anybody the license to speculate on any rubbish about us,"" added Malaika and Arbaaz.Months of rumours and speculation preceded Malaika and Arbaaz's announcement of separation. While some reports claimed that Malaika was seeing a UK-based businessman, fingers were pointed at Arjun Kapoor too for having caused a rift between the couple. There were rumours that Arjun Kapoor and Malaika were involved in an affair that led to the separation.However, in their joint statement, Malaika and Arbaaz clarified that too. They said, ""We are not separated because of a third random person, like there were stories of a friendship between a businessman and Malaika. Nor was it about his family disapproving of her lifestyle, nor does she feel that her husband is not financially stable. She is not crying on her brother-in-law Salman's shoulders, asking him to help. They are our family, so please don't talk about them like that."" "

3382,People who criticised my appearance were right: Parineeti,"Parineeti Chopra is making her comeback of sorts in Bollywood. The 28-year-old actor, who was last seen in 2014 film Kill Dil, is gearing up for the release of her upcoming film Meri Pyaari Bindu. In an interview to India Today, she talks about her film, her break, her love for music and Golmaal 4. It has been almost two and a half years since we saw a Parineeti-starrer film. What did you do during this break? If it was two and a half years long, this question was valid. My break was only ten months - I didn't shoot a film for 10 months. I shot the song (Dishoom), did the Dream Tour and I was shooting ads. So this break that everybody has made a thing about really didn't happen. I know this industry is like 'Three days she is not in news, oh she's done'. But never did anybody write me off. I pride myself for the goodwill I earned for the work I did in the first three years. I could hold on to that great work in the beginning and confidently come back with a film two years later.So did you use those 10 months to reassess your career and bring about a change?That was the plan. You are able to really think about what works for you and what you excel at. Adi (Aditya Chopra) and Maneesh (Sharma) were my third eye through that journey and gave me their opinion. I was also working on my fitness. I really had some health issues and had to see a lot of doctors. Let's talk about the Parineeti 2.0. The old Parineeti got a lot of flak for her appearance. How did you cope with all the criticism?When they were criticising me, they were absolutely right. I'd look at that photo and I know that's not me. I'm a very self-assured person which is what makes me real. I'm not showing off by doing so. I have come from that background and family. I knew when I lose the weight, everybody will say that she looks so good. Now I'm in the best-dressed lists. Don't you think actresses face a stern test? Surely it shouldn't all be about 36-24-36.Today 36-24-36 is not the perfect figure. We need to change that stat I feel. Films are a visual medium. They are inspirational. Even when I watch a film, I feel like I want to wear that skirt, have that hair and have a Raj (in my life). Why are films so big? Because they make you cut off (from the real world). If you are not inspirational, then you cannot be on the larger-than-life celluloid. When you are at that global pedestal, you need to inspire - visually, with you performance, voice and dancing. You need to deliver a beautiful image. Fitness is a part of that. And you have been propagating being fit in this new avatar.I have seen the craziest hip-hop dancers who are size 18. They are fit and flexible, so healthy and glowing; (have the) best hair, nails and skin. Fitness does not equal to (being) thin. You need to be your fittest self. It automatically comes from fat loss. People think 'Oh you just go on a treadmill and you lose weight because you want to wear a bikini.' I have been struggling with my weight for 12 years of my life. I couldn't work for more than four hours. I was very big, a UK size 16. My heart and liver were taking a strain, I have an injured knee because of my weight. People don't think of that.Is your approach to picking roles different from before? I definitely feel more responsible towards entertaining the audience. I want to deliver more entertainment value. I definitely want to do an action film. I just hope that they can write a good action character for a girl and it comes to me. I really wanted to do a comedy and I'm doing Golmaal.You are juggling promoting Meri Pyaari Bindu and shooting Golmaal 4. I miss my boys. They are my gang now. Within two days, I was part of that mad team. They literally invest their time, money and skills in playing pranks on each other. When earlier journalists would ask me do you play pranks on sets, I'd be like No. Now [with Golmaal] you are constantly looking behind your back because anything could happen.Rohit Sir (director Rohit Shetty) keeps his team together. They are a seven of us but really it is a cast is of 19 actors.Were you worried that you would get lost in the crowded ensemble?I'm a lover of Golmaal. When Rohit Sir called, I knew I want to do this film; I'm doing this film. Listening to the script was a formality for me. But of course I had to listen to it. I loved my role. I also wanted to work with Rohit Sir. I'd be a tree in his film.Coming back to Meri Pyaari Bindu. How is Bindu different from other romantic comedy heroines?She is irresponsible, doesn't finish things and leaves relationships. She keeps moving cities and jobs. She is not very stable because she wants to fly like a bird, and explore everything and keep trying. That's what makes her stand out. She is not the demure, stereotypical Bollywood heroine of yesteryear. She is spunky. What I do have in common with her is that she loves music and singing, and is energetic. When she enters the room, everybody has to look at what she is doing. We are seeing the lesser-seen musical side of yours in this film. Maneesh Sharma mentioned how you'd sing in the corridors of YRF office. Yes, I used to walk and sing on the first floor when I was working in the marketing department. I think music is what defines me as a person. I really want to take music more seriously. I want to release many more songs and do live shows."
3383,Indonesians protest after Christian Guv jailed for blasphemy,"The jailing of Jakarta?s Christian governor on blasphemy charges has sparked outrage from his supporters in Indonesia, rights organisations and the EU.On Tuesday, a court in the capital of the world?s largest Muslim-majority country found Basuki Tjahaja Purnama ? better known by his nickname Ahok ? guilty of blasphemy, sentencing him to two years in prison.?The EU has consistently stated that laws that criminalise blasphemy when applied in a discriminatory manner can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief,? the EU delegation to Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam said in a statement posted on its website. The Jakarta-based rights group the Setara Institute described the verdict as a ?trial by mob?, while the British ambassador to Indonesia, Moazzam Malik, who is Muslim, tweeted a message of support.I know Ahok. Admire his wk for Jkt. Believe he isn't antiMuslim. Praying for BuVero&kids. Leaders must step up to protect tolerance&harmony. https://t.co/JcxsteEfB4At City Hall on Wednesday morning, an estimated 1,000 people wearing red and white, Indonesia?s national colours, gathered for a spontaneous choir performance in support of Ahok. Conducted by the musician Addie MS, the crowd sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya, and Pancasila Garuda, a song about Indonesia?s founding principles of unity and diversity.When words fail, music speaks #paduansuarabalaikota #ahok #saveahok #peace #nkrihargamati #garudapancasila pic.twitter.com/CdY64EGiDNOthers registered their opposition to the verdict and sentencing by tweeting under the hashtag #RIPHukumIndonesia, which means ?rest in peace Indonesian law?.The Ahok case has been watched closely as a marker of the commitment to religious tolerance and pluralism in Indonesia, where religious hardliners have been playing an increasingly prominent role in politics.In an unusual move, the panel of five judges on Tuesday dismissed the prosecutor?s recommendations to drop the initial blasphemy charges due to insufficient evidence. Prosecutors had recommended the governor instead face a sentence of two years? probation, and one year in jail if he reoffended. But the judges ? citing among others the ?expert? opinion of an Islamic vigilante group leader ? said they found the minority governor convincingly guilty of blasphemy, incarcerating him for two years. Ahok for months faced the wrath of hardline Islamists after he cited a Qur?anic verse on the campaign trail last September. The verse, he said, had been manipulated by some religious leaders to justify the claim the Muslims should not vote for non-Muslim leaders.Uproar over an edited version of the speech that went viral spilled into a series of angry mass rallies spearheaded by Islamists since late last year, and has catalysed the deepening of religious and ethnic divides in the capital.Some observers argue that religious hardliners may have swayed the Indonesian judiciary.International human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the verdict would tarnish Indonesia?s reputation for religious tolerance and pluralism, and urged the country to repeal its ?unjust? blasphemy law. Ahok has indicated he will appeal against the ruling."

3390,My father and I have a crush on Tabu: Ayushmann Khurrana,"Ayushmann Khurrana, who will be next seen in Meri Pyaari Bindu opposite Parineeti Chopra, talks about his his role in the film, his journey in Bollywood and his upcoming projects. How did Meri Pyaari Bindu come to you?I had read this script three years back. That time Yash Raj Films was not producing it. I was very excited about it. Back then they were looking for a girl for the part and couldn't find one. Suddenly, Adi Sir [Aditya Chopra] called to say that there is this script called Side B Love. That was its title then. I knew I loved it. It was so novel and nostalgic. Suprotim [Sengupta] expresses beautifully with his words. You play a pulp fiction writer. Have you read any? That writing is not my zone. I am not a fan. In Meri Pyaari Bindu, I'm a Hindi writer. There are some raunchy titles like Awara Dhoban and Chudail ki Choli. I imagine Bindu in every character. The film thrives on nostalgia, and nostalgia never gets dated right? Yes. It just gets better. But this is not all about the past. It's a life journey of these characters from 5 to 35. It is also set in current time.Bindu and Abhimanyu make a mix-tape. Have you made a mix-tape for somebody?Of course. For myself and my first girlfriend who went on to become my wife. I made her a 90-minute Hindi English mix. There was no graph. It was random. There was a Kishore Kumar ""Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas"" and then suddenly Bryan Adams' ""Best of Me"".Your brother Aparshakti Khurana has also taken to films. Is there a rivalry now?There could be no rivalry because there is so much of love. I am a protective brother. He respects me a lot. Though there is a difference of three years, he touches my feet. He does it in front of everybody deliberately. And I'm like Ghar pe kar le, but he will do it even at award shows. He has been doing so since childhood so he suddenly won't change his ways. We look similar but we are so different. I was a co-curricular captain of the school. He was the captain of the sports team. He has captained the Haryana under-19 cricket team. He is one of thode rare Punjabis who can speak fluent Haryanvi too which is why he fit so well in Dangal too. Your career graph is defined by playing the loveable fool in romantic comedies such as Vicky Donor, Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Meri Pyaari Bindu. But you are now turning things around by working with Sriram Raghavan. Tell us about it.I think you need time for everything. You have to establish yourself as a guy next door, and then do something radical later. If you try something radical with every film, then you will get exhausted.  You are limited some way or the other even if you are multi-talented. Though a lot of thrillers were being offered to me, I wanted a Sriram Raghavan thriller. He is the master of thrillers. This is the perfect time for that metamorphosis. This is the most challenging role of my life.And you are working with Tabu.Oh My God, she is stunning. My father and I both have a crush on her. I start shooting it in June.   Then there's Shubh Mangal Savdhan, a remake of a Tamil film, with Bhumi Pednekar.It is the antithesis of Vicky Donor. I play a guy who has erectile dysfunction. The filmmaker, RS Prasanna, calls it a spiritual remake of the original. It came out in 2012 and  was seen as the Vicky Donor of south even though the topics are different. Shubh Mangal Savdhan is radical, quirky and a family film despite the topic.Are you happy with the movie offers coming your way?I am fortunate that I have been a part of two National Award-winning films in five years. I am getting good choices being part of boutique management of Yash Raj where they handle a fixed number of actors. I am pretty content. Would you want to try action, a genre that heroes want to have in their filmography?I started with an unconventional film and I am unconventional in a way. I want to just own that space. I want to be myself. If everybody aspires to be a conventional, commercial hero, who will become the Amol Palekar and Farooq Sheikh of this generation? "

3404,Noise pollution threatens protected wildlife areas: Study,"Washington, May 7 (PTI) Noise pollution caused by humans is pervasive in the US protected areas, posing a threat to land masses that harbour wildlife and provide places for respite, recreation, and natural resource conservation. Protected areas in the US represent about 14 per cent of the land mass. Researchers, including those from Colorado State University in the US, analysed millions of hours of sound measurements from 492 sites around continental US. The results summarised predictions of existing sound levels, estimates of natural sound levels, and the amount that human-made noise raises levels above natural levels, which is considered noise pollution. Researchers found that human-made noise doubled background sound levels in 63 per cent of US protected areas, and caused a ten-fold or greater increase in background levels in 21 per cent of protected areas. In other words, noise reduced the area that natural sounds can be heard by 50 to 90 per cent. This also means that what could be heard at 100 feet away could only be heard from 10 to 50 feet, researchers said. This reduced capacity to hear natural sound reduces the restorative properties of spending time in nature, such as mood enhancement and stress reduction, interfering with the enjoyment typically experienced by park visitors. ""The noise levels we found can be harmful to visitor experiences in these areas, and can be harmful to human health, and to wildlife,"" said Rachel Buxton, from Warner College of Natural Resources in the US. ""We were encouraged to see that many large wilderness areas have sound levels that are close to natural levels. Protecting these important natural acoustic resources as development and land conversion progresses is critical if we want to preserve the character of protected areas,"" she said. High levels of noise pollution were also found in critical habitat for endangered species, namely in endangered plant and insect habitats. ""Although plants can not hear, many animals that disperse seeds or pollinate flowers can hear and are known to be affected by noise, resulting in indirect impacts on plants,"" said Buxton. "

3418,"Delhi cabbie who returned bag worth ?8 lakh has ?70,000 loan","The foreign currency notes and valuables in the black backpack worth Rs 8 lakh, forgotten by its owner in his taxi, could have taken care of everything Debendra Kapri has ever wished for. The 22-year-old taxi driver returned it to its owner and bought contentment instead. His conscience and his father?s lessons on honesty figure higher on the list than his needs, he says. Last week, Kapri walked into a police station at Delhi?s domestic airport to deposit a bag left behind in his vehicle by a passenger earlier that day. The officer on duty was shocked to find that it contained gold jewellery, a laptop, an iPhone, a camera and $70 ? items amounting to a whopping Rs 8 lakh.Kapri claimed that he knew what was there inside the bag but decided to return it to its owner. The police later found out that the bag belonged to Mubisher Wani, a resident of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. He was given back the bag that same evening.Kapri is a debt-ridden man and is struggling to repay a loan of Rs 70,000 to a private financier in his home town in Bihar?s Banka. His father took a loan of Rs 1 lakh in 2008-09 on a 5% per month interest rate to marry off two of his daughters. The simple farmer, who did not have a permanent source of income, could not even pay the monthly interest amount. The interest amount accumulated with every passing month and the pressure to return the money intensified, initially with warnings and later with life threats to the family members. With the added compound interest, the Rs 1 lakh loan increased to Rs 2 lakh within 2 years.The family sold a small piece of their land but it was not enough to pay off the loan. In 2011, Kapri?s elder brother left home for Rajkot in Gujarat to earn a livelihood. But his meagre income proved insufficient to cater to his personal expenses and needs of his family of 5, leave alone repaying the loan.?My father was under stress and mother fell sick but we had no money to buy medicines for her. With each passing day, our financial condition was deteriorating. Though I was only 17, I had no choice but to quit my studies and support my family in the crisis. In 2012, I came to Delhi in search of a job,? Kapri says.The youngest among four siblings, Kapri recalls he could appear only in 2 subjects in his Class 10 examination because he met with an accident. ?That accident changed my life. Family?s responsibility took over my books and dreams of becoming an engineer. Destiny brought me to the streets of the national capital and I ended up becoming a cleaner at a taxi stand at Delhi airport,? he says. Before completing two years, Kapri had learnt how to drive a car. His cousin, Pintu, took up the role of his driving instructor in addition to being his only guardian in the city. Kapri now aspires to own one for a better life. Kapri lives in a 10x10 rented room with his two roommates, who too work as drivers, on the first floor of a building in Mehram Nagar, an urban village near the Delhi airport. An iron door opens into the room that has an open kitchen with a gas stove and cylinder on the floor. The front wall has 2 cloth hangers that struggle to lift the weight of the clothes of the 3 occupants. On the left side is a small mirror which the room partners share. ?The fan in my room blows out hot air and makes it difficult for us to fight the scorching heat and sleep. But the kind of appreciation I have received from my friends, neighbours from my home town and here in Delhi after the incident gives me peace of mind. I stuck to the lessons of my father and feel satisfied. My moral values are greater than my personal needs,? Kapri said. Asked what he would do if he has Rs 8 lakh of his own, Kapri says, ?I will first repay the loan. From the remaining amount, I will purchase my own taxi that will certainly improve my lifestyle.?"

Speaking to reporters at Rajghat today morning, Mishra claimed to have seen Kejriwal accept Rs 2 crore in cash from Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Kumar Jain.

3429,Bihar ministers rent out bungalows for parties at ?3L a day,"In a major embarrassment to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, two ministers of his Cabinet have been exposed by India Today of renting out their official bungalows for private weddings and parties. The daily earnings of these two ministers from the business is approximately Rs  2.5 lakh to 3 lakh per day, an amount which is unaccounted.Abdul Gafoor, minister for minority affairs in Nitish govt has been allotted a posh and palatial bungalow at 3, Taylor Road in Patna. Several acres of open land inside this bungalow is decked up round the year with pandals and lighting during wedding season. At this time, almost every day there is a wedding function happening at his bungalow.Similarly, 12 Strand Road, the official bungalow of Minister for Culture and Youth Affairs Shiv Chander Ram is decorated throughout the year for wedding and private parties. According to 2011 figures, a Bihar legislator draws a monthly salary of Rs 1 lakh and it appears that this huge salary added with privileges and perks is not enough for these two ministers who are renting out their official bungalow for commercial purpose.Opposition leader and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has criticized Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for allowing his ministers to rent out their official bungalows for weddings and parties. He demanded sacking of both ministers from the Cabinet.""Both ministers have turned their official bungalows into banquet halls. Both are earning crores by renting out their bungalows. Nitish should sack them and FIR should be registered against them. Nitish has also attended marriages in these bungalows. No way can the ministers make commercial use of the official bungalows,"" said Sushil Modi. Both ministers, however, remained unavailable for comments."

3437,Bengaluru molestation cases rise 417% over decade,"In a decade to 2016, the incidents of molestation (under Section 354) reported in Bengaluru increased more than four-fold, statistics compiled by the city's Commissioner of Police show. Yet, according to our analysis of police data, of the 4,241 complaints filed between 2006 and 2016, the conviction rate was 0.37 per cent (16 cases).The number of complaints under under Section 354 (assault to outrage the modesty of a woman) rose from 150 in 2006 to 776 in 2016. Experts say this could be because of an increase in the number of incidents as well as greater willingness on the part of women to register complaints.This data project could serve as a template for how police in India's burgeoning cities can make sense of their crime data in public interest.Section 354 includes sexual harassment (354A), use of criminal force with intent to disrobe (354B), voyeurism (354C) and stalking (354D). The data obtained from the Bengaluru commissionerate group these offences under ""molestation"".MOLESTATION CASES SHOCK NATIONBengaluru entered 2017 with reports of mass molestation of women in the city's bustling MG Road and Brigade Road areas despite deployment of thousands of police personnel. The reports came as a shock to residents and for people across the country who believed the city to be safe for women.Kavya S., 24, was on her way to work when a stranger attacked her in public. ""It was around 8:30 am in broad daylight, I was walking to work in Kormangala when a stranger grabbed me and tried to kiss me in front of dozens of people! No one came to my help but when I screamed and kicked him, they yelled at me and asked me to leave him,"" she recounted.Kavya immediately filed a complaint with the local police under Section 354, but did not pursue the case once she shifted her residence. ""Police officials were very cooperative,"" she recalled, ""but I couldn't follow up on the case as I had to shift my house and job.""Cases such as Kavya's are increasingly common, although Bengaluru police say they are working to improve the law and order situation for women. ""We have identified areas that are hotspots for crimes against women and launched 51 Pink Hoysalas (mobile units) that are dedicated to women. We have also launched an app called 'Suraksha' last week (April second week). Anyone can inform us if they are in danger and we would reach the spot in 10 minutes,"" S. Ravi, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime), told IndiaSpend.JUSTICE DELAYEDBengaluru's criminal justice system is marred by delays, as with the rest of India's. Of the 4,241 molestation cases reported, 2,248 (53 per cent) are pending trial, according to data from the Bengaluru City Police Commissionerate.Among the cases tried, there have been 523 acquittals (12 per cent) and 16 convictions (0.37 per cent) -- even as the police consider 97 per cent of cases to be ""true"" after investigation. A decade earlier, the figure for ""true"" cases was 84 per cent, indicating more open-mindedness in dealing with women's complaints as well as better effort on the police's part to investigate.However, lawyers and activists believe the large proportion of acquittals is due to shoddy investigation. ""In most crime against women cases, especially the molestation cases, the accused get acquitted or the cases are kept pending for years,"" Pramila Nesargi, a noted lawyer and a well-known women's rights activist, said. ""The main reason for all these is the reluctance of police in getting proper evidence.""Bengaluru's conviction rate for molestation is indicative of the larger problem nationwide. ""Few women who survive sexual assault have a pathway to justice and recovery from their horror,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy, in a statement.The government needs to think from women's perspective, Rani Shetty, coordinator of Vanitha Sahayavani, a government agency that provides rescue and support services for women in distress, and operates from the office of the Commissioner of Police, told IndiaSpend. ""I have met many victims of molestation whose cases have been pending for years. The legal system needs to be strong, there should be fast-track judgment for any cases related to women,"" she said.As per law, the police have to file a chargesheet within 90 days of a crime being reported. ""[I]n most cases, they fail to do so, and this in turn affects the court proceedings,"" Ugrappa V.S., a member of the Karnataka Legislative Council and chairperson of the expert committee to prevent crimes against women and children, told IndiaSpend.THE DANGER OF DELAYSJudicial delays, which make it easy for the accused to get bail, can be extremely dangerous for victims of sexual assault. In one case, a Grade IX student was molested by her 25-year-old neighbour. Her family filed a Section 354 case at the Peenya police station and the accused was arrested immediately. On his release on bail within four months, he kidnapped the girl and raped her. He is back in jail now.""What happened to me shouldn't happen to any girl. He has to be punished,"" the girl told IndiaSpend.""If the police had taken strict action on his first crime, they could have prevented the second incident. Now he is in jail but he might do the same thing when he comes out,"" her father said.The city's burgeoning population, with a massive influx of immigrants, could be one of the factors behind molestation cases such as the one that took place on New Year's eve, former Lokayukta Justice (Retd) N. Santosh Hegde said speaking at a private college in the city in March 2017. The 2011 census had pegged Bangalore city's population at 84.4 lakh. By 2016, it had risen to more than 1.15 crore.""They come alone. They stay alone. And the manly desire is always there,"" he said at the discussion about immigrants, adding that the benefit of anonymity in an overcrowded city apparently emboldens them to pursue their pervert desires. He also cited a lack of morals as one of the reasons.By Elizabeth Mani for IndiaSpend.org"

The government announced draft rules for a national 'no-fly list' which proposes a ban on domestic air travel  that can last for a period ranging from three months, to two years or beyond.Gaikwad called it a ""welcome move,"" but he had more to say.""But these are just draft guidelines. I think there should be stricter guidelines for the airline staff as well"" Gaikwad told India Today in Mumbai.""Sometimes even passengers have to suffer due to the behaviour of airline staff, that also should have some strict guidelines...Forget us, we usually fly on domestic routes, but you can ask passengers who travel long distance,"" he added.THREE LEVELS OF OFFENCESThe proposed draft has three levels of offences that can lead to a person being listed on the No Fly List.The first level includes disruptive behaviour such as physical gestures, punishable by suspension for three months. The second level is for physical abuse - pushing, kicking, sexual harassment and the like - punishable by a 6-month suspension.Level 3 offences include murderous assault, life-threatening behaviour, or causing damage to aircraft operating systems. The penalty for such offences would be suspension for two years or more.The new guidelines also have a penalty structure through which an unruly passenger can be fined up to Rs 5 lakh for delaying a flight by an hour, Rs 10 lakh for delays longer than an hour, and Rs 15 lakh for delays longer than two hours."
3441,Drinking water standards have improved in India: WWC,"From Lalit K Jha Washington, May 6 (PTI) The standard of drinking water in India has improved in the last five years but a lot of work still remains to be done, the head of the World Water Council has said. World Water Council (WWC) recently carried out a major survey on water awareness in major parts of the world, including India. The survey was done ahead of the 8th World Water Forum that is scheduled to take place in the Brazilian capital Brasilia in March 2018. As per the survey, more than one-third of Indians think that not enough is being done to achieve the UNs Sustainable Development Goals to make water and sanitation for all a reality by 2030, World Water Council president Benedito Braga said. ""There has been some work done in the past five years to improve the drinking water standards in India. Of course, theres still a lot of work to do there,"" Braga told PTI. Braga said more than three quarters of the Asians were convinced that governments need to lead the fight to make global access to safe drinking water and sanitation reality. According to the survey, 31 per cent of Indians said they had been in a situation where it was unsafe to drink water but they had no other choice and suffered from diseases like diarrhoea and gastroenteritis. A majority (71 per cent) of Indians said that safe drinking water had improved over the last five years. The survey stated that 62 per cent of the Indians said they believed that the government was doing enough to support access to safe drinking water. Referring to the Swachha Bharat Campaign, Braga praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his efforts towards clean drinking water and sanitation. ""I think Mr Modi is very much concerned with water and sanitation issues.

He is cooking at a prominent restaurant. The minor has turned 23 years old now.?He was always worried about getting lynched and that is why he was sent to the southern part of the country.

""My hope is that we can bring into the country a good tasting mango, which the Alphonso is, counter-seasonally to supplement the mango lovers desire for fruit in the Australian off-season,"" he said.

He asked his party men to do so to substantiate his allegation that the BJP and the RSS are using the issue of cow protection for garnering votes.

3462,Sennheiser launches headphones priced at ?45 lakh in India,"Successor to the legendary Orpheus, audio giant Senheiser's new HE 1 headphones are now available in India. And just like the legendary Orpheus, the new HE 1 will cost you a bomb to own. Senheiser has launched the premium, high-end headphones in India at an alarmingly high price tag of Rs 45,00,000. But, if the HE 1 are anywhere near as close as the headphones they will replace, well, they ought to be expensive.  ""For a decade now in the Indian market, Sennheiser has shaped the industry and has been at the cutting edge of audio by continuously re-defining the gold standard of what is technically possible,"" said Sennheiser CEO Daniel Sennheiser. ""With the HE 1, we are once again pushing the boundaries and are showing that we can repeatedly set new benchmarks in excellence and reshape the future of the high-end audio world.""The new HE1 use a completely new amplifier concept that combines the superior impulse processing of a tube amplifier with the low distortion of a transistor amplifier ""to perfection"" according to the company. There are a total of eight vacuum tubes that process the incoming signal. The advantage of tube amplifiers is their superior impulse processing. However, one challenge is their sensitivity to air-borne-noise. For this reason, the amplifier housing is crafted from granular, in homogeneous Carrara marble and is freely suspended with the amplifier. The decoupling of the tubes in combination with the damping properties of the marble has the effect of reducing structure-borne noise to an absolute minimum. The tube amplifier stage is followed by a patented ultra-high impulse amplifier stage that is directly integrated into the cups of the headphones.Senheiser has used gold-vaporised ceramic electrodes in the headphones. The advantage of this design, it says, is the extremely short distance between the amplifier and the diaphragm which is less than one centimetre in the new HE1. Thus, the headphone system requires far less power for charge reversal. At a voltage of only around 5 Volt, the music signal is transmitted balanced to the high-voltage amplifier integrated into the headphones and is amplified there. This ensures extremely high impulse fidelity with relatively low power requirements. Just like the tubes of the tube amplifier, the system's MOS-FET transistors have a square characteristic curve to prevent the hard distortion that occurs in amplifiers with bi-polar transistors.Sennheiser uses a new amplifier concept in a class that the audio specialist calls Cool Class A. In the low-frequency range, Cool Class A provides Class A power at any volume. In the high- and ultrahigh-frequency range, the amplifier switches from Class A to the usual Class AB operation. That will, however, only be the case when listening to a very unusual frequency spectrum."
3463,SBI declines to share amount of money in suspended accounts,"By Ashwini Shrivastava New Delhi, May 4 (PTI) The SBI has declined to share the quantum of money lying in suspended bank accounts in which the interest amount of customers, who do not claim it due to religious reasons, is kept. Replying to an RTI query, the State Bank of India (SBI) said it does not maintain such information in its database ""in normal course of business and extraction of the same will be voluminous and time taking activity"". ""We, therefore, decline your application under Section 7 (9) of RTI Act as the information sought by you is likely to divert disproportionately the resources of the bank,"" it said in reply to the application filed by PTI. The section bars disclosure of information which would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority or would be detrimental to the safety or preservation of the record in question. The bank was asked to provide details of suspended accounts including their total number and amount lying in them. It was also asked to share details of guidelines to deal with such amount of interest. The interest money which is not claimed by people due to religious obligations is kept in suspended bank accounts. According to an article published in Reserve Bank of Indias journal in 2005, it was reported that in India thousands of crores earned in interest is kept in suspended accounts. ""Research reveals that a handsome bulk of money in India owned by believers is lying idle, which if invested in profit sharing basis and utilised properly, can have a major impact on the Indian economy,"" reads the article. As an initiative towards the introduction of Islamic banking in India, a single window can be set up in banks like SBI to do Islamic banking. ""This can tap the unused money lying idle that can be utilised for the economic and social benefit of the nation,"" it had suggested. "

The officer manning the reception desk was shocked when he found that the bag contained gold jewellery, a laptop, one Apple iPhone, a camera, 70 US dollars ? all valued over Rs 8 lakh. Kapri told him that he had come to return the bag that belonged to a passenger who had forgotten it in his cab. Kapri said that he had dropped the passenger in central Delhi?s Paharganj area and he did not know his identity or where he went from Paharganj. ?I was impressed with the honesty showed by Kapri. He knew the value of the items in the bag but decided to return it,? said the officer.Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (IGI), said that the duty officer alerted the station house officer (SHO) who in turn informed him about the matter. ?The bag was thoroughly checked. In addition to the US currency notes and costly electronic items, the bag also contained important documents,? said Bhatia. Kapri claimed that after dropping the passenger outside a hotel in Paharganj, he returned to Connaught Place area. He was cleaning the windowpanes of his Maruti Esteem car when he saw a backpack lying on the rear seat. ?I was confused and did not know what to do with the bag. I could not return it to its owner because I did not know in which hotel the passenger was staying. I opened the bag and found cash, jewellery and electronic items. I decided to hand it over to the police,? said Kapri, who came to Delhi four years ago from Bihar?s Banka district for livelihood. While scanning the documents, the DCP said, a wedding card was also found. The card had a mobile number on it. A call was made on the mobile number and it was received by a man in Srinagar. When the man was asked if anybody known to him was travelling to Delhi by air, he claimed that his brother reached Delhi in the evening to seek a Visa for himself from the US embassy. He was informed about the bag and was asked to inform his brother in Delhi about it. As the police personnel were making a list of the items in the bag on a piece of paper, Kapri stood by and ensured that no item is misplaced. ?I insisted that the list should be made in my presence and even requested for a copy of the list. I wanted to keep it as a proof so that if by any chance the owner of bag finds me and asks me to return the bag, I can prove that his belongings were safe in the police custody,? Kapri told HT. While the policemen were busy completing the legal formalities, the owner of the bag, Mubisher Wani, arrived at the police station and claimed that his brother from Srinagar informed him about his missing backpack. Kapri identified the man as the same passenger whom he had dropped in outside a hotel in Paharganj. The passenger gave details of the items which were there inside the bag. Upon confirmation that the bag belonged to him, all items were returned to him. ?Even the bag owner appreciated and thanked him for his efforts His act is exemplary and need highest recognition. I have recommended for a suitable cash reward for the Good Samaritan,? said Bhatia. "

""We are unlikely to be found together at a coffee shop anytime soon. We had a heated exchange on the field some years ago and it made headlines all over the world. While I have moved on in life as I feel these things are part and parcel of the game, Gautam for some reason can't get over it. Good luck to him!""Gambhir and Afridi were involved in an ugly spat in Kanpur during the third ODI of Pakistan's tour of India in 2007. The umpire had to intervene frayed tempers.Afridi went on to explain that he enjoyed ""excellent relationships"" with the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh."

3477,"1,500 AIIMS doctors to learn taekwondo for safety at work","Rising violence against doctors has prompted nearly 1,500 resident doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to learn taekwondo so that they are able to defend themselves on duty. In March, after three incidents of violence were reported in three days, more than 3,000 resident doctors, working in the emergency, out-patient departments and wards, went on strike for five days in Maharashtra. ?We had supported our counterparts in Mumbai by wearing helmets to work in March. This is because we are genuinely concerned about our safety. Keeping the same in mind, we had requested the AIIMS administration to organise self-defence classes for us. They granted us permission to conduct taekwondo classes in AIIMS gymkhana club,? said Dr Vijay Gurjar, president of the resident doctors? association.The doctors, in batches of 100, will train at the gymkhana club between 7-8 pm every day from May 15. The basic course will be for 6 months and the black belt course for 30 months.According to a report in the Lancet journal, while 75% doctors in tertiary care hospitals face physical or verbal violence at work at least once in lifetime, over 40% of them faced it in 2016.The problem is multifactoral. Overcrowding in public health facilities forcing doctors to spend less time with patients, corruption and over-charging for services (in which the referring doctor gets a cut) leading to the breakdown in the doctor-patient trust are some of the reasons recognised by the study.?Doctors are forced to spend less time listening to the patients or their caregivers. The concept of shared decision making is almost absent. The average conversation between a doctor and a patient might last just a few seconds,? said Dr Vijay Nath Mishra, neurology professor, Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Varanasi. VIOLENCE REGISTRYThe IMA will launch a registry where doctors can report any incidence of violence along with evidence such as videos, photos, CCTV footage, and newspaper clippings. The doctors? body will then conduct an investigation and do a root cause analysis.?This will help us in understanding why violence is happening, predict when the violence might happen and look at measures to prevent such incidences,? said Dr Dr KK Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).WHAT PATIENTS WANT?Confrontations happen because of the anger caused by non-fulfilment of desire. Hence, we need to understand what the patients really want,? said Dr Aggarwal.A survey done by the IMA found that 90% of the patients wanted doctors acknowledge and address them, 92% wanted doctors to listen, 89% wanted the doctors to explain what the illness is and keep them informed throughout. Around 75% of the people also wanted their doctors to review ? ask them if they understood and, if not, help them understand. 40% of the respondents also wanted the doctors to thank them. ?The patients said that they always thank the doctors, but they wanted that the doctor thank them in return as they gave them an opportunity to treat their relative. We called the study ALERT ? Acknowledge, Listen, Explain, Review and Thank,? said Dr Aggarwal."

This includes 111 Maoists in 2017 (till date). 205 surrenderees have already been enrolled as Special Home Guards. Now, 11 more are being enrolled as Special Home Guards and another 9 cases are in process. Thus, total of 225 surrenderees will be enrolled for employment till date.""Banerjee also announced that the Bengal government had designed rehabilitation programme with incentives, providing employment and entrepreneurial opportunities to those who have surrendered so that they become a part of mainstream.""Apart from employment, surrendering Maoists get financial incentives as well as assistance for housing, medical and child education, as per norms set up by the government,"" Banerjee announced.Also read:Bengal BJP workers who lunched with Amit Shah at Naxalbari join Mamata's Trinamool CongressDidi a hijra: BJP leader launches attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee BJP's multi-pronged strategy to corner Mamata Banerjee and wrest power from Trinamool in West BengalNarada scam: ED registers case against 12 Trinamool Congress leaders"
3489,Why is there such fear: Mamata on Kajol's 'beef' statement,"West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee today reacted sharply to Bollywood actor Kajol's controversy where the actor reportedly clarified what meat she had eaten recently.Speaking at a public rally in North Dinajpur district, Mamata said the actor had come up with the clarification out of fear. She said there was an environment of fear in which everyone was operating.Slamming the BJP, she said, ""Why is there such fear? Whom should we fear? Since I'm always vocal, they threaten us with the CBI and the ED; threaten us with jail all the time. But let me tell them, even if you put entire Trinamool Congress in jail, I don't care. People will give you a fitting reply.""""They only know how to create riots. They are not in favour of Hindu religion, they are a blot on the name of Hinduism,"" Banerjee added. The Trinamool Congress supremo's comment comes after the actor tweeted a clarification that a video that she had earlier shared on social media was not of beef but ""legal"" buffalo meat.""A video of me at a friend's lunch said that there was a beef dish at the table. That's a miscommunication. What was shown was buffalo meat, that is legally available meat. I'm issuing this clarification because this is a sensitive matter that may hurt religious sentiments, which is not my intention,"" Kajol has tweeted on Monday soon after her video went viral a day before.KAJOL CLARIFIED IT WAS NOT BEEF Though the actor has removed the video from her Facebook page, it has already gone viral. In the video, Kajol is seen visiting a restaurant whose chef is her friend. When Kajol asks her friend about a dish that he had served, he explains it as ""beef pepper water with dry lentils and dry beef"".

3499,"Don?t waste time, no vacancy for PM post till 2024: Paswan","oppn (With additional inputs) New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) Union Minister and LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan today took a dig at the opposition parties over their attempts at unity, saying they should not waste their time as there is no vacancy for the prime ministers post till 2024. Briefing reporters following his partys national executive meeting on April 29 and 30 in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, he heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ""pro-Dalit"" measures. Paswan also expressed confidence that Modi would remain in charge till 2024. The National Executive of LJP also demanded an amendment to be made in the Constitution to implement immediate reservation in promotion. Keeping in view, the continued lack of government jobs, the party also demanded the early implementation of reservation in the private sector, Paswan said. The party also adopted a resolution to make one crore new members throughout the country during a membership drive from August 15 to January 26. He compared his former colleagues-turned-rivals, who are now in different parties, to an orange fruit which looks whole from the outside but is divided inside. ""People like Nitish Kumar (JD-U), Mulayam Singh Yadav (Samajwadi Party), Lalu Prasad (RJD) can never be one. They should stop wasting their time in looking for a prime ministerial candidate. There is no vacancy,"" he said. The next Lok Sabha elections are due in 2019 and the BJP- led NDA is in a buoyant mood following its massive win in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. Paswan raked up corruption allegations against Prasad and his two sons, both ministers in the Nitish Kumar government, and said the JD(U) chief is troubled over this. His party, he said, is also keen on the passage of the Womens Reservation Bill, which mandates 33 per cent quota for women in Parliament, with separate reservation of SCs, STs and OBCs within it. ""All parties are ready for this,"" he said. The LJP also favours simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls and they should be funded by states, he added. Paswan repeated his partys demands, including quota in private jobs and reservation for Dalits, minorities, backward and tribal students in private schools. He also pithed for starting Indian Judicial Service on the lines of IAS to recruit judges with quota provisions. Lauding Modi for promoting places associated with Dalit icon B R Ambedkar, he said his last speech delivered in the Constituent Assembly be included in school syllabi. Ambedkar should also be given a Nobel award, he said. The honour is generally not bestowed posthumously. His party has sought free land for landless people for residential purpose and clean water for every citizen, he said. The LJP resolution demanded that all villages with 20 per cent and more population of Dalits be brought under the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gramin Yojna for their fast development. "

You are all aware that a certain financial model was proposed in 2014 and accepted by the other cricket boards and the same was meant to commence in 2015/2016. However, soon after the said financial model had been accepted, there were discordant voices that emanated from other cricket boards (which have been noted by the General Body of the BCCI in February 2016) and the ICC decided to set up a working group to re-visit the said financial model.3.One of the members of the Committee of Administrators (Mr. Vikram Limaye) had attended the ICC Board meeting in February 2017 on behalf of the BCCI pursuant to the order dated January 30, 2017 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The ICC Board meeting in February 2017 was within a week of the Committee of Administrators being appointed. At the said meeting, Mr. Limaye had proposed that instead of there being any voting on the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model, the same should be taken up during the meetings to be held in April 2017 since there wasn't sufficient time for BCCI to study the proposals and formulate its position. Also, the proposals presented had stated that there was no scientific basis for the revised financial model that was being proposed. However, on the insistence of a majority of the ICC Board, a vote was taken on the approval of the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model. The same were approved 'in-principle' (with only Mr. Limaye and the representative from Sri Lanka Cricket voting against whilst the representative from Zimbabwe Cricket abstained), subject to the right of ICC members to raise any issues they have on the proposals in advance of the meetings to be held in April 2017.4.In order to ensure that the BCCI's stand in relation to the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model was placed on record with the ICC sufficiently in advance of the meetings to be held in April 2017, we instructed the CEO to address a detailed communication dated March 19, 2017 to the ICC (in response to an email addressed by the ICC to Mr. Limaye) setting out our preliminary observations on the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model (See Annexure 1). We understand that this communication has already been brought to your attention during the Special General Meeting held on April 18, 2017. We would like to highlight that the said communication specifically draws the attention of the ICC to the Members Participation Agreement dated 12th October 2014 entered into between the BCCI and IBC (a subsidiary of ICC) (""MPA"") and states that the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model will, if adopted, entitle BCCI to exercise certain rights under the MPA and also to avail remedies under applicable law.5.In order to ascertain the rights and remedies that may be available to BCCI under and in relation to the MPA and otherwise in the event the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model are adopted, the Committee of Administrators had also asked the CEO to obtain necessary legal opinion(s) from appropriate foreign lawyers on the matter. We have been informed that this legal opinion has already been shared with the existing office bearers of the BCCI and we expect that they will appropriately brief you on the same.6.In the meantime, after the ICC Board Meeting held in February 2017, other cricket boards as well as the ICC were desirous of engaging in discussions and their representatives approached the Committee of Administrators for this purpose, since there were no functioning office bearers until the clarification issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on March 24, 2017. During the said discussions, we made it clear to the ICC and other cricket boards that Mr. Limaye had only been asked to attend the meetings to be held in February 2017 and he may not necessarily be asked to attend the meetings to be held in April 2017. Accordingly, the discussions between the ICC, other cricket boards and us were limited to ascertaining their respective positions and scope for negotiation. No commitment whatsoever has been made by us on behalf of the BCCI either to the ICC or to any other cricket board.7.During the course of the said discussions, the ICC and other cricket boards clearly communicated to us that the events that transpired in 2014 had led to an immense trust deficit between them and the BCCI and there was a need for trust-building in order to work together going forward. They acknowledged the fact that BCCI contributes much more to the ICC than other cricket boards and also recognized that BCCI should therefore get its due share under the revised financial model and were prepared to negotiate an amount that would be acceptable to BCCI and other cricket boards. At the same time, they made it clear that the share that was envisaged under the financial model that was put in place in 2014 was too high and not acceptable to them. They believed that a fair share could be something in between what was proposed in 2014 and the new financial model and could be negotiated between BCCI, other cricket boards and the ICC without the need for a vote. Our discussions indicated that the ICC Chairman and other cricket boards were keen to find an acceptable middle ground to resolving this matter in a collaborative/ non-confrontational framework.8.After the order dated April 17, 2017 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court appointing Mr. Amitabh Choudhary as BCCI's representative to the ICC, we had invited the existing office bearers for a meeting on April 21, 2017 so that we could update them on the above developments prior to the ICC meetings. Whilst the Acting President and the Hon. Treasurer expressed their inability to attend the said meeting, the Acting Secretary did meet with us on April 21, 2017 and we briefed him on our prior discussions with the ICC and other cricket boards so that he would be aware of their respective views/ positions.9.We believe that the outcome of the ICC Board Meetings held in Dubai during the last week of April 2017 could have been avoided if the resolutions passed during the Special General Meeting held on April 18, 2017 had authorized the Acting Secretary to arrive at a negotiated outcome (within certain parameters akin to those set out during an earlier Special General Meeting held on February 19, 2016) instead of directing him to either seek deferment of a vote and, if that was not agreed to by the ICC and other cricket boards, vote against the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model. In fact, we had communicated our apprehension regarding the lack of flexibility available to the Acting Secretary to negotiate when we met him on April 21, 2017.10.The decision regarding what amount/ share and changes to the ICC governance structure the BCCI should finally agree to in the course of negotiations with the ICC and other cricket boards is certainly one that needs to be taken by the General Body of the BCCI as it has long term implications. However, since we have had the benefit of independently interacting with the ICC and other cricket boards as mentioned above, we consider it our duty to communicate our views on the matter to you prior to the SGM:(a) It is extremely unlikely that the ICC and other cricket boards will agree to the amount/ share envisaged under the financial model that was put in place in 2014.(b) The ICC and other cricket boards will certainly agree to an amount/ share that is higher than what is envisaged under the revised financial model.(c) It is in the interests of Indian cricket for the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC and other cricket boards to arrive at an amount/ share that is somewhere between that envisaged under the financial model that was put in place in 2014 and that which is envisaged under the revised financial model. An audio recording of the Special General Meeting of the Members of BCCI held on February 19, 2016 reveals that there was a recognition that the BCCI should work in a collaborative framework with ICC and negotiate a lower amount that is acceptable to all. BCCI should continue to adopt this approach in its negotiations with ICC. Specific details of the maximum reduction in the amount/ share that the then President and Secretary of the BCCI were authorized to negotiate and agree were verbally agreed although the same does not find mention in the minutes of the said Special General Meeting.(d) It is not in the interests of Indian cricket for the BCCI to take any drastic step/ measure which may result in breakdown of negotiations between the BCCI, ICC and other cricket boards, especially since there is sufficient time between now and the ICC Conference to be held in June 2017 for a negotiated outcome to be arrived at.11.We are aware that apart from the revised ICC financial model, issues relating to the revised ICC governance structure are also important for the BCCI. This is evident from the fact that a majority of the preliminary observations contained in the detailed communication dated March 19, 2017 addressed by the CEO to the ICC under our instructions (See Annexure 1) are in relation to the revised ICC governance structure viz. scheduling of bilateral tours, membership issues, powers of the ICC Chairman, voting issues, composition of committees, etc. We believe that the way to address these issues is also through negotiation with the ICC and other cricket boards and there is sufficient time between now and the ICC Conference to be held in June 2017 for a negotiated outcome to be arrived at. However, a negotiated outcome may be jeopardized if the BCCI takes any drastic step/ measure at this stage which will only precipitate matters."
3503,Kumar Vishwas's comments will benefit 'other party': Sisodia,"Delhi chief minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal has called an urgent meeting of party?s political affairs committee (PAC) on Wednesday to settle the discord with old confidant Kumar Vishwas. (LIVE UPDATES)In a desperate bid to keep party together, Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, visited Vishwas?s residence in Vasundhara late on Tuesday night where senior leaders Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh were already holding a meeting with him. ?Vishwas is an integral part of the party. He is angry but will come around. We are going to my place to have tea,? Kejriwal said after the meeting following which they left for the CM?s residence in Civil Lines. Vishwas is also attending the PAC meeting at 11 am.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas on Tuesday accused a section of party colleagues of conspiring against him and said he will ?take a decision tonight?, potentially hinting at quitting amid raging dissension in Delhi?s ruling party.Within hours of the announcement, Sisodia criticised Vishwas for speaking ?only to the media?, indicating the leadership?s disapproval of the poet-turned-politician?s public statements.Vishwas sparked the crisis in the AAP after he challenged the party?s stand blaming electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the defeat in the recently held municipal polls.A few days later, another AAP leader Amanatullah Khan ? the Okhla legislator ? described Vishwas as an ?RSS agent? and accused him of conspiring to take control of the party, led by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Kejriwal is struggling to keep the party together after a series of election setbacks, including the drubbing in Punjab and the municipal polls.On Tuesday, a teary-eyed Vishwas said Amanatullah Khan was just a ?mask? used by some AAP leaders to attack him.?And then I realised this is not being said by an MLA (Khan)...he is only a mask and someone else is speaking behind him,? Vishwas said.Vishwas also blamed a ?coterie? within the AAP for its election reverses but did not elaborate.Though Vishwas said he will not join ?any other party?, he kept his options open for leaving the AAP.?I don?t want to become the chief minister, deputy chief minister, convener of a party and neither do I want to join any other party.... I didn?t come to do this. I will take a decision tonight....?An hour later deputy, Sisodia criticised Vishwas for speaking to the media rather than raising his concerns in the party forum.?We have gone to meet him several times. Arvind himself met him and spoke to him for three hours at his house. Still, he is not coming to attend the PAC (political affairs committee meetings), and is only talking to TV,? Sisodia said.?Party workers know very well which party or which power is benefitting from his repeated statements on TV channels,? the deputy CM said, seen as a reference to the BJP.He also rubbished Vishwas? claims of being one of the founders of the AAP.?He (Vishwas) is repeatedly saying this party was founded by three people ? Arvind Kejriwal, me and Kumar Vishwas. This is totally worng. This party was formed by the lakhs of party workers in India and abroad.?Kejriwal had earlier defended Vishwas by terming him a ?brother?. But political experts believe that Vishwas may have have crossed the red line for the temperamental chief minister, who is often accused of building the party around himself."
3504,SC raps Bihar govt for seeking 2 years to fill 174 vacancies,"New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) ""You are making fun of this court,"" an anguished Supreme Court told the Bihar government today, pulling it up for seeking two years time to appoint 174 stenographers in the police and rejecting its roadmap to fill up the vacancies in the force. The apex court, which is monitoring the filling up of police vacancies in all states, asked the Nitish Kumar government to revise its roadmap and submit a fresh one. ""This proposal is completely unacceptable. You want time till 2019 to fill up the posts of 174 stenographers. This is not done. You are making fun of this court. You can hold one single test for stenographers and recruit them,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar said. The bench, also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul, said it was angry with the way the roadmap was presented to it and asked the Bihar government to file a fresh proposal for filling up of vacancies in police by Friday. ""You should now file a fresh affidavit explaining a reasonable roadmap. If you do not revise it, then you will be in serious trouble. Revise and come on Friday or we are going to send someone who prepared this roadmap to jail,"" the bench said. With regard to West Bengal, the bench accepted the roadmap given by the state and asked it to fill up the 25,487 vacancies of constable by 2020. The West Bengal government informed the court that the process for filling up police vacancies was on and by July 31, a total of 4357 posts would be filled up. The apex court directed the state government to fill up 8000 posts of constables every year from 2018 till 2020 and ""meticulously adhere"" to the time-line. In case any vacancies remains, then it should be filled up by 2021, it said, adding that for any breach of the time schedule, the concerned DGP (Recruitment) and Additional Secretary (Home) would be personally responsible. The state government said that out of 1173 vacancies of junior constables, 465 have been filled up as on date and by 2020, all the remaining vacancies will also be filled up. It told the bench that till date, it has 253 vacancies for the post of Sub Inspectors and this number would rise to 3175 by 2018. The apex court directed that the state government should fill up 700 posts this year and from 2018 till 2020, it should fill up 800 annually. The hearing remained inconclusive and will continue tomorrow. The apex court had on April 24 directed Uttar Pradesh government to fill over 1.5 lakh police vacancies in the state in fours years, saying filling up of the posts will help in dealing with the law and order problem. It had also directed the governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to fill up about 45,000 such vacancies in a time- bound manner, while expressing dissatisfaction with the responses of West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand in the matter. The apex court had directed the UP government to start filling up the currently 1,01,619 vacant posts in the police and asked the state government to start recruiting 30,000 constables every year from August 17 till August 2020, apart from filling up of 11,376 posts of Sub-Inspector. It had directed that 3,200 posts of Sub-Inspector should be filled annually from January 2018 till January 2021, apart from filling up the promotional posts every year. The apex court had also accepted the roadmaps of filling up of police vacancies in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and asked them to complete the process of recruitment in a time-bound manner. The bench has accepted the roadmap given by the three states to fill up the vacancies and sought similar fresh road maps from Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. It also asked the Home Secretaries of Gujarat, Telangana and Rajasthan to be personally present on May 1 and suggest the roadmap to fill up over 50,000 police vacancies. The bench was not satisified with the responses of West Bengal, Bihar governments whose Home Secretaries were summoned by the apex court on April 17 and had asked them to furnish detailed roadmaps for filling up of the long pending vacancies by May 1. It had said that Uttar Pradesh has 1.51 lakh vacancies, West Bengal has 37,325, Karnataka has 24,899, Jharkhand 26,303, Bihar 34,500 and Tamil Nadu has 19,803 posts vacant. "
3505,China has vested interest in solving Kashmir issue: Media,"Due to its almost USD 50 billion investment in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that passes through Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), China has a ""vested interest"" in acting as a mediator between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue, according to an article in a state-run daily.      The article published in the Global Times, a publication of the ruling Communist Party of China, suggested Beijing's latent interest in playing a bigger role in the region. Claiming that China had mediated between Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya refugees issue, the article said, ""China has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, but that doesn't mean Beijing can turn a deaf ear to the demands of Chinese enterprises in protecting their overseas investments."" ""Given the massive investment that China has made in countries along the One Belt, One Road, China now has a vested interest in helping resolve regional conflicts including the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan"", it said. China's recent mediation between Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya issue shows the increased ability of Beijing in resolving conflicts beyond its borders to maintain regional stability, the article said. CHINA AT THE CENTRE OF REGIONAL POWER SHIFT""China has been at the centre of a regional power shift, thus the country now needs to learn how to act as a stabilising force and conflict mediator in the region"", it said. There is so much to learn for China about how to play its role as a regional power at a time when the country is witnessing a boom in outbound direct investment, the article said. ""For instance, while China has the capability to resolve conflicts through mediation given its increased economic influence, the nation needs to be very prudent in dealing with other big powers, India included, in the region,"" it said. ""In fact, mediating between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue would perhaps be one of the toughest challenges facing China in dealing with regional affairs to safeguard its overseas interests"", the article said. This is perhaps the first time that Chinese official media started floating Beijing's interest in playing a mediatory role to resolve the Kashmir issue. WHAT IS CHINA'S OFFICIAL STAND?China's official stand is that the Kashmir issue left over from history should be resolved between India and Pakistan, though Beijing has been stepping up its investments in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). While China in the past has played down reports of the presence of its troops in PoK, saying that they were there to deliver humanitarian assistance, its USD 46 billion China- Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) through the disputed Gilgit and Baltistan region increased its involvement in the disputed areas. The CPEC project will link the Pakistani city of Gwadar to China's Xinjiang via a vast network of highways and railways. India has protested to China over the CPEC and is yet to name an official delegation to take part in a summit of the Belt and Road initiative, of which CPEC is a part. The summit is to be held from May 14-15. Chinese official media also referred to last month's participation of Chinese troops for the first time in the Pakistan Day parade as a sign of the Chinese military playing a role in regional stability.(WITH INPUTS FROM PTI)Also read | Is China using its One Belt One Road initiative as an alibi to meddle in Kashmir dispute?Also read | Pakistan using proxies in Jammu and Kashmir for its foreign policy goals: Top US experts"

3508,Tata Teleservices fires up to 600 employees amid competition,"New Delhi, May 2 (PTI) Tata Teleservices has fired between 500 and 600 employees to tide over difficult times in the hyper-competitive telecom market. As many as 500-600 employees have been impacted by the lay offs in sales and other related functions, two people familiar with the matter said. The lay-offs are across locations, they said, adding that the severance package being offered to the employees impacted by the decision is one months salary for every year of service. An e-mail sent to Tata Teleservices did not elicit a response. Sources in the company said that these are challenging times for the telecom industry. ""What most of the operators including Tata Telservices are doing is workforce rationalisation, to stay competitive in line with the needs of the market,"" they added. The lay-offs comes at a time when the telecom industry has been witnessing an intense tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio, whose disruptive positioning in the market has left most of the telcos bleeding. The telecom operators are facing tremendous pressure on revenue and profitability even as the industrys debt has soared to nearly Rs 4.6 lakh crore. "
3509,"Railways denies food scam, says RTI reply had typing errors","Central Railways on Tuesday issued a clarification on reports of a scam that alleged its catering department had purchased food products at ten times their MRP, saying typing errors in the RTI reply caused the miscommunication.Three inspectors involved in making the RTI reply have been suspended.THE 'MISCOMMUNICATION'Responding to an RTI filed by an activist Ajay Bose, Central Railways had revealed that food items like 100 gram packets of Amul curd were purchased at Rs 14 crores for around 15,336 units (i.e. Rs 972 per unit). Similarly, refined oil had been purchased at Rs 253 a litre, and tur dal and moong dal were purchased for Rs 157 per kilogram -- which is several times higher than the existing market price. Cold drinks and water bottles were also purchased at prices twenty to thirty times higher than their actual price.But in its clarification, Central Railways denied any such purchases, saying there were typing errors in the RTI reply, which led to the miscommunication. Central Railways said that they purchased 58 tins of 15 ltrs each which amounted Rs 72,034. RTI reply suggests that 58 ltrs were purchased for Rs 72,034. Similarly, while Amul Curd purchase is shown as 15,336 cups of 100 gms for Rs 1,49,19,934.32, the actualr purchases were 15,336 cartons with 108 curd cups.NO STOCK MISMANAGEMENTOn the allegations of stock mismanagement, Central Railways said that the RTI reply suggested that the units offered were more than units purchased, which was again a mistake on the part of people who made the RTI reply. CR claimed that the stock available with the railways was not shown, leading to the confusion.""Total stock available includes opening stock and stock purchased. But in the reply only stock purchased was shown which led to miscommunication,"" said Shailendra Kumar, CCM ,CR.The three inspectors who have been suspended are from the commercial department of CR and were involved in making the RTI reply. Accepting the negligence Kumar said, ""This RTI reply had 1200 pages. While making these replies there was negligence. We have initiated action and will make sure that this is not repeated.""CR also said that they had issued a clarification to the RTI activist and a revised reply was given to him the very next day."

3511,Complaint against Baahubali 2 director for casteist dialogue,"While Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is breaking records all over India and making a few abroad as well, back in Hyderabad, the film has enraged quite a few people.According to a report in The News Minute, members of a group called the Arekatika Porata Samithi filed a complaint with the Hyderabad police on Sunday against SS Rajamouli, the director of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. The reason? Well, he has allegedly hurt the sentiments of the Katika community.The offensive Baahubali 2 scene in question features Katappa (Sathyaraj) saying ""Katika cheekati"" in the second half of the film. The group which has lodged the complaint says that the term is a 'caste slur' and since they are from the Katika caste, the dialogue was 'humiliating their community name'.The group has also filed a complaint with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) where it has demanded for the words to be removed.""We Katika people indulge in the trade of butchery, to sell meat of goats, sheep and hens, to provide healthy food to the society, as part of our livelihood. We are not harsh, inhuman and anti-social people as the movies try to portray us,"" the complaint read.""We have become a synonym for any anti-social activities. Even in schools and colleges, our children are facing social stigma,"" the complaint went on to add.The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh governments recognise the Katika or the Arekatika community under the Backward Class (BC) category. However, a police officer belonging to the Banjara Hills police station, where the complaint was filed, said that no case has been registered against the makers of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion yet and that they are taking legal advice."

That Farhan is now legally divorced from Adhuna Bhabani has added fuel to the fire and it was being said that he is planning to make his relationship with Shraddha official soon.

3513,Scientists eliminate HIV infection in 'humanised' mice,"New York, May 2 (PTI) Scientists have successfully removed HIV DNA from the genomes of animals - including a humanised mice - using a powerful gene-editing tool, an advance that may help eliminate the virus in humans in future. The team is the first to demonstrate that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication can be completely shut down and the virus eliminated from infected cells in animals with a powerful gene editing technology known as CRISPR/Cas9. Researchers, including those from Temple University in the US, build on their previous study in which they used transgenic rat and mouse models with HIV-1 DNA incorporated into the genome of every tissue of the animals bodies. They demonstrated that their strategy could delete the targeted fragments of HIV-1 from the genome in most tissues in the experimental animals. The researchers genetically inactivated HIV-1 in transgenic mice, reducing the RNA expression of viral genes by roughly 60 to 95 per cent. They then tested their system in mice acutely infected with EcoHIV, the mouse equivalent of human HIV-1. In the third animal model, latent HIV-1 infection was recapitulated in humanised mice engrafted with human immune cells, including T cells, followed by HIV-1 infection. In all three animal models, the researchers utilised a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector delivery system based on a subtype known as AAV-DJ/8. ""The AAV-DJ/8 subtype combines multiple serotypes, giving us a broader range of cell targets for the delivery of our CRISPR/Cas9 system,"" said Wenhui Hu, associate professor at Temple University. Researchers also re-engineered their previous gene editing apparatus to carry a set of four guide RNAs, all designed to efficiently excise integrated HIV-1 DNA from the host cell genome and avoid potential HIV-1 mutational escape.

But that was all he could do as the next four points went Ghosh's way and with that the title was secured.""I had to start the sixth game aggressively because I kept thinking about my first big international title. It was hard to win against Amalraj. It took some time to adapt to the ball, harder than the one we used before enabling more power but less spin,"" said Soumyajit in a release.""Now I'm the third to win such a tournament. I'm really happy. But being the top seed, I felt the pressure all through.""Amalraj, even though he lost the singles final, said he was pleased to bag the winners medal in the doubles."
3525,"Airtel misleading, discriminating against users, accuses Jio","By Prasoon Srivastava New Delhi, May 1 (PTI) In a new face-off, telecom operator Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel is violating tariff rules by issuing misleading offers and arbitrarily discriminating among its own customers subscribing to the same plan. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has demanded highest penalty imposed on Sunil Bharti Mittals Bharti Airtel by telecom regulator Trai alleging that the two plans of Airtel -- priced at Rs 293 and Rs 449 respectively -- are being marketed in a misleading manner. It said that Airtels advertisements of these offers are an attempt to lure prospective subscribers making them believe that they will be provided 1 GB data per day for 70 days. ""However, the subscribers who do not satisfy Airtels dual criteria, will be provisioned only 50 MB data and post that, they will be charged the exorbitant data tariff of Rs 4,000 per GB,"" Jio said. Under the said plans, Airtel is offering unlimited local and STD calls along with 1 GB of mobile internet per day for 70 days to customers with 4G handsets and 4G SIM. In case of Rs 293 plan, unlimited calling is limited within the Airtel network. Other Airtel customers availing these plans get only 50 MB of data usage per day for 35 days. Jio said that Airtel is offering these recharges ""in a grossly discriminating basis by providing the headline data benefits of 1 GB data per day for 70 days only to the new subscribers holding a 4G handset in conjunction with a 4G compatible SIM card. All other subscribers are provided substantially lower data benefits of 50 MB for 35 days."" Jio said that with reduction in validity of the plan for other set of customers, the value of voice calls also gets reduced. ""Airtel has chosen to create an arbitrary distinction on the basis of subscribers possessing 4G handset and 4G SIM. It has arbitrarily reduced the validity of voice benefits under same recharge for the same class of subscribers without a 4G handset or 4G SIM...,"" Jio said. The new entrant alleged that the ""arbitrary classification"" by Airtel is a gross violation of the telecom tariff order 1999. When contacted, a Bharti Airtel spokersperson denied the allegations and said that the company is in full compliance of all regulatory guidelines, including tariff orders. ""These allegations are nothing but a continuation of Reliance Jios standard ploy of blaming others for all its problems, including network deficiencies,"" the Airtel spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that what is even more ironic is that Jio itself offered free services for several months but is now pointing fingers at other operators, who are merely offering simple discounts to their own customers to retain them.

He deserves a Y-grade security at least,? he said.Police security at Tiwari?s house was increased after the incident. Senior police officers said that Tiwari?s personal security will be reviewed and increased if needed."

3543,"Ola losses tripled to ?2,311 crore during 2015-16","By Stuti Roy and Moumita Bakshi Chatterjee New Delhi, Apr 30 (PTI) SoftBank-backed cab aggregator Ola posted a consolidated loss of over Rs 2,311 crore -- about Rs 6 crore a day -- during fiscal 2015-16, on account of heavy advertising and promotional expenses and high employee cost. The Bengaluru-based firm, which is locked in an intense battle for leadership with US-based Uber, has seen its losses widen about three times from Rs 796.11 crore in 2014-15, Ola said in a filing with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. ANI Technologies -- which runs Ola -- did see its revenues registering a stellar growth at Rs 758.23 crore during 2015-16 compared to Rs 103.77 crore in the previous fiscal. Emails sent to Ola remained unanswered. Anchal Agarwal, co-founder of research and analytics firm Tofler said while the absolute amount of losses have indeed widened, the loss margin has ""reduced considerably"". ""They spent almost Rs 8.5 for every rupee earned in 2014 -15. That number is down to almost Rs 4 for every rupee earned for 2015-16. With the pull-back in incentives etc in recent months, its possible this has now dropped to levels at par with e-commerce companies that spend roughly Rs 2-3 for every rupee earned,"" she added. The consolidated numbers include financials of ANI Technologies, Ola Fleet Technologies (leasing business), Serendipity Infolabs (Taxi For Sure) and Zipcash Card Service (46 per cent ownership). In August 2016, Ola shut down the TaxiForSure (TFS) business, about 18 months after acquiring the rival for USD 200 million. As per the filing, Olas losses were widened on account of employee related expenses rising over five-fold to Rs 461.60 crore in the said fiscal from Rs 85.16 crore in 2014- 15. Similarly, Ola expanded its advertising and promotional expenditure to over Rs 437.89 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 99.84 crore in the previous year. Both Ola and Uber have loosened their purse strings to bring more riders and driver partners on board, offering them discounted rides and incentives, in a bid to wrest control of the lucrative Indian market. Over the last few years, the explosion of smartphones in India ? the world?s second largest telecom market in terms of subscriber base ? has made it more convenient for consumers to book a cab on the go through apps and secure payment options. Companies like Ola and Uber have made booking a taxi ride as easy as a couple of quick taps on the phone screen. Since ANI Technologies is not a publicly-traded company, it is not obligated to disclose quarterly performance. It has raised investments of over USD 1.5 billion from investors, including SoftBank Group, Tiger Global, Matrix Partners, Steadview Capital, Sequoia India, Accel Partners US and Falcon Edge. "
3544,Govt taking realistic steps for affordable housing: Parekh,"Mumbai, Apr 30 (PTI) A large number of big corporates and reputed developers are entering the affordable housing segment, attracted by huge tax benefits and reforms initiated by the government, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said. He also expressed hope that real estate prices would decline more once RBI allows banks and housing finance firms to lend to developers for land purchases and approval processes for projects are further streamlined and shortened. Lauding the NDA government for coordinated efforts of the Prime Ministers Office with various ministries and departments on the Housing for All by 2022 mission, Parekh said this has been one of the main promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several steps have been taken, especially this year, to achieve this goal. ""I will call this years Budget an affordable housing budget. I am very excited about housing growth in India in next 3-5 years and I have never been so enthused about it,"" Parekh told PTI in an interview. Parekh, Chairman of housing finance major HDFC Ltd, said the government is focusing on ""practical and realistic steps"" which are good for developers, consumers and even the lenders. Speaking in detail about various schemes and measures, Parekh said the government has extended the 100 per cent tax deduction scheme for affordable housing projects approved between June 2016 and March 2019, by two more years till 2021. ""What this effectively means is that any developer, for affordable housing project, has to pay zero tax. I do not know of any industry in India where you have to pay zero tax even if you make profit, other than in affordable housing. ""It shows the importance, the urgency and the critical need that housing requires in a vast country like ours,"" he said. Parekh also said that a clear carpet area definition has been put in place for affordable housing units -- 30 sq meters in four metros and 60 square meters for rest of the country. ""They have also made it clear that these measurements are for municipal limits, so areas like Navi Mumbai and Thane would not have Mumbai limit of 30 sq mt. The business leader said the infrastructure status to affordable housing is another major benefit that builders have been given by the government and this will help lenders too. ""This means they can take long-term funds from institutions such as insurers and pension funds. Insurance firms and pension funds need to invest certain portion of their money in infrastructure sector and the affordable housing now qualifies for those funds. ""The RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Act) and these new measures will also stop the practice of builders taking full money in advance from the customers and then building the project entirely on the basis of customers money. ""The tax benefit is attracting builders in a big way to affordable housing. We have seen big builders in big cities approaching us that they want to get into affordable housing. We are supporting the builders for getting into affordable housing,"" he said. Talking about other steps that would give a big fillip to the sector, he said the housing loan interest subsidy scheme is a game changer that gives subsidy of up to 6.5 per cent. The scheme was initially launched for EWS/LIG but now has been modified and extended to MIG also which is a very good step. ""There are 3-4 other things which the government has done. Holding of property is down to 2 years to qualify as a long term capital asset,"" he said. On other good provisions, Parekh said when a builder earlier had unsold flats in a completed project, the notional rent was taxed on these unsold flats from the year in which the project was completed. Now, notional rent of properties will be taken as nil for one year from the date of obtaining completion certificate. "

The civic body, in a report prepared at the end of the 2016-17 fiscal, has identified these hotels among 166 alleged defaulters, which have dues pending above Rs 10 lakh for the last four years. However, according to NDMC officials, all the hotels have moved court challenging the tax assessment and any further action by the civic body cannot be taken since the matter is sub-judice.

As per the process, the properties are issued notices to clear the dues. If they fail to do so, NDMC can attach their assets. However, in this case the matter is in court, the official said. Meanwhile, the spokespersons at Taj Palace and Claridges denied any pending dues, saying their payments till date have been made. A Delhi Golf Club official said there was a ""huge issue"" with the tax assessment leading to the amount in hundreds of crores.

These people are enemies of the party. They should mend their ways.

3550,"Women, kids can use hotel toilets for free in South Delhi","Starting Monday, women and children will no longer have to go looking for public washrooms to relieve themselves after a long day of shopping at South Delhi markets. Simply walking into the nearest restaurant and conveying their need to the staff will make posh toilets accessible to them completely free of cost.South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) commissioner Puneet Kumar Goel said that hotels, restaurants and eateries in the area will open their toilets to public use from May 1. However, men have been kept of out of the scheme due to privacy issues cited by various hotel associations. The move would allow women and children to access washrooms even in five-star hotels of South Delhi, Goel said, adding that the decision was taken on a suggestion from lieutenant governor Anil Baijal.?We want the hotels and restaurants to take this directive in the right spirit. The facility will be reviewed on the basis of feedback provided by the catering establishments,? said SDMC additional commissioner (health) Meeta Singh.National Restaurants Association head Riaz Amlani said women and children find it hardest to locate proper washrooms for use. ?Security concerns, coupled with the fact that some restaurants and bars don?t allow single males, made us keep men out for now,?

It would not be good for business if such people have to cross paying customers to reach washrooms located at the rear of the establishment, he added."
3551,Ramdev chants 'Om' instead of saying 'Hello' over the phone,"New Delhi, Apr 30 (PTI) A young Ramdev was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school as the curriculum was a leftover of the colonial education policy, fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul. Saraswatis book ""Satyarth Prakash"" had a deep impact on Ramdev. While greeting someone over phone, Ramdev never says hello. Instead he chants Om. The first chapter of ""Satyarth Prakash"" explains the etymology and significance of Om. After reading the book, Ramdev wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages. As the path of ancient sages also meant practice of celibacy, so he took a vow - to never marry. A new book ""The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market"" by Kaushik Deka has these nuggets of information. ""Satyarth Prakash"" was written in Hindi in 1875 by the renowned religious and social reformer and the founder of Arya Samaj. The book formed the intellectual core and social, political and economic philosophy of the yoga guru. It was a book primarily explaining the true tenets of Hinduism, making an appeal for one uniform religion based on the principles of the Vedas. ""This book was a revelation to me. It awakened my inner- self, gave me a sense of purpose in life. It introduced me to the wisdom of our ancestors. I wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages,"" Ramdev is quoted as saying. ""Satyarth Prakash"" not only changed Ramdevs life but also gave it a direction and purpose. ""He was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school where the curriculum was a leftover of the education policy introduced by British politician Babington Macaulay (1800?59), who was instrumental in the introduction of English as the medium of instruction for higher education in India. ""He knew his parents would never agree to his decision of quitting regular school, where he was doing exceptionally well. So one fine day he fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul, a traditional educational institute based on Vedic principles, at Khanpur in Haryana,"" Deka writes. Ramdev was the brightest student in the government primary school, located in the village, where he studied till the class V. For higher classes he moved to the Shahbajpur High School, a few kilometres away. ""I used to buy second-hand books, yet I always topped my class,"" claims Ramdev. ""Dayanandji made me realise the value of the treasure trove hidden in Vedic education. Its a progressive approach based on tark (logic), tathya (facts), yukti (argument) and praman (evidence). The goal of British education system was to enslave our mind and curb free and logical thinking,"" he says. ""The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market"", published by Rupa, offers a detailed account of Ramdevs journey from attaining moksha in the Himalayas to ruling the market, especially the FMCG sector, with his Patanjali products. It captures the rise and rise of Patanjali and the various factors that worked for it, most importantly, the vision of Ramdev and the assistance of his associate Acharya Balkrishna. "

3555,EC clears Manish Sisodia in 'office of profit' case,"The election commission (EC) has cleared Delhi?s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and party colleague Surinder Singh of allegations of holding an office of profit, a charge that could have disqualified them as legislators. The complaint against Sisodia and Aam Aadmi Party MLA Singh was forwarded to the poll panel by the president?s office but was found to be untenable, sources said.The poll panel?s findings have been sent to President Pranab Mukherjee?s office . Sources said the President has to accept the EC?s recommendations.The decision comes at a time when the election commission is hearing a similar complaint against 21 AAP legislators, who were appointed parliamentary secretaries to assist various ministers of the Arvind Kejriwal government. The appointments were struck down by the Delhi high court.The poll panel?s decision, which can have a bearing on the stability of the government, is likely to be announced by May 15.BJP leader Vivek Garg wrote to Mukherjee, demanding Sisodia?s membership of the Delhi assembly be cancelled as there was no provision for the post of deputy chief minister in the NCT of Delhi act, which deals with government formation, assembly and other such subjects. Sisodia?s appointment amounted to holding an office of profit, Garg had said. Members of Parliament and state assemblies can?t accept government positions that offer money or other benefit such as office space or even a car. A violation can lead to the disqualification of a lawmaker under the ?office of profit? rules that are meant to ensure independence of legislature and guard legislators from executive?s inducements.Singh was accused of benefitting from his membership of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation by illegally occupying four government flats.Delhi?s ruling party has been at loggerheads with the poll panel. Stung by a series of poll defeats, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and several colleagues have raised doubts over the electronic voting machine, alleging EVMs were tampered with to benefit the BJP.Kejriwal even questioned impartiality of election commissioners OP Rawat and AK Joti. Rawat has recused himself from hearing all cases and complaints related to the AAP, saying it was important to protect EC?s credibility.In 2006, Congress president Sonia Gandhi quit her Lok Sabha membership after the Opposition accused her of holding an office of profit when she was appointed the chairperson of the national advisory council, a body set up in 2004 to advise prime minister Manmohan Singh.

The filmmakers along with the Film Distributors Association and the Film Producers Association want to ensure better business for Pakistani films during the Eid holidays.

3558,Joshua defeats Klitschko to be crowned triple world champ,"Anthony Joshua delivered one of the great nights in British boxing annals by stopping Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round to be crowned IBF, WBA and IBO world heavyweight champion in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Saturday.Britain's unbeaten IBF title holder earned a sensational victory by knocking down the 41-year-old former champion twice in the 11th and penultimate round before the referee stepped in to save Klitschko from any more punishment.What was hailed as the biggest fight night ever staged in a British ring, watched by the largest crowd for a boxing show in Britain for 78 years, lived up to its billing.It was a thrilling contest which saw both combatants clamber off the canvas seemingly on the verge of defeat and looks destined to be recalled as one of the great heavyweight title fights.Joshua survived a knockdown for the first time in his professional career in the sixth round and looked close to surrendering his unbeaten record until his late bombardment forced the stoppage.In a sensational fifth round, Joshua knocked down Klitschko only to end up hanging on desperately at the end of the round as the Ukrainian launched a remarkable comeback.The veteran had even looked the more likely winner as he defied a 14-year age gap and was outboxing Joshua in the latter stages until the Briton produced a blistering finish to take his unbeaten record to 19 straight stoppage wins.Both men had to dig deep and both looked close to exhaustion before the 27-year-old Joshua's youth, fitness and sheer power took over in a penultimate round that sent the huge crowd into ecstasy as two barrages sent Klitschko down.""What can I say? 19-0, three-and-a-half years in the game. As I said, I'm not perfect but I'm trying,"" Joshua told the cheering crowd from the ring.""As boxing states, you leave your ego at the door and you respect your opponent. So a massive shout out to Wladimir Klitschko.""""The best man won tonight and it's a massive event for boxing,"" responded Klitschko after his second defeat in succession at the hands of a British heavyweight following the loss of his titles to Tyson Fury 17 months ago after an 11-year reign.""Two gentleman fought each other. Anthony was better today. It's really sad I didn't make it.""The fight attracted a gate that had not been matched for a British show since Len Harvey fought Jock McAvoy for the British light-heavyweight title at another London venue, White City, in 1939.The mutual praise between Joshua and Klitschko echoed the civilised and respectful way the two former Olympic champions had behaved in the build-up to the contest but there was nothing civil about the brutal punishment they dished out to each other.After four rounds of feeling each other out, with Klitschko's movement and Joshua's power quite apparent, the crowd were not prepared for an astonishing fifth round.First, Joshua launched a blistering left hook and followed up with a flurry of punches that saw the Ukrainian drop to his knees and, when he rose groggily, take a standing count.Klitschko suddenly looked old and the end seemed nigh as Joshua roared in to finish the job but that was when he found his champion's spirit in his desperation, landing a big left of his own to leave Joshua in real peril."
3559,Govt conducting selective raids against AIADMK: Stalin,"Days after targeting the BJP-led central government for enforcing Hindi on non-speakers, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) working president and treasurer MK Stalin today fired yet another salvo.

""The union government does not seem the least bit concerned about that. It is now crystal clear that it is the hand of the BJP, which is in control of the central government, which is directing this blindingly obvious one-sided application of 'selective raids' and 'selective arrests' against one faction of the AIADMK, while turning a blind eye and allowing strong incrimination evidence against the other faction of the AIADMK to gather dust,""  said Stalin.The DMK working president then accused BJP-led Centre of resorting to tactics to gain foothold in Tamil Nadu. He added that BJP was raiding sitting Tamil Nadu ministers and intimidating IAS officers.He went on to say that the BJP government did not show any urgency to address the teeming issues like water disputes with neighbouring states or attacks on Tamil Nadu fishermen. ""The BJP government has not invested even one per cent on trying to solve the real problems facing the people of Tamil Nadu,"" said the DMK treasurer. MK Stalin furthermore demanded answers from the BJP government on its apathetic view towards Tamil Nadu.  In the end, he urged the prime minister to ensure that Tamil Nadu has a legitimate and stable government that functions with full powers as every state government is enshrined with the constitution.தமிழ ?  ?ர ? ? ம ? ? ? ? ? நின ? ? ? ? ?ம ? மத ?திய  ?ர ?ின ?  ?தி ?ார ம ?றல ? ?ள ?! pic.twitter.com/K3PGcc8GfvWith inputs from Pramod Madhav Also read:BJP govt destroying nation's unity by imposing Hindi on non-speakers, says MK StalinTamil Nadu bandh: Anti-social elements may instigate violence, says DMK's Stalin"

When Katrina was asked how she is getting better with age, she said, ""Got to live up to the name. Jawaani hai toh you got to keep doing it.""Katrina said that even though a lot of people tell her that she looks like her mother, as a child, she looked like her father.

3583,Too many shops at Delhi Airport may hinder evacuation: Panel,"Too many shops and restaurants at New Delhi?s Indira Gandhi international airport could jeopardise lives of passengers during an emergency but the airport operator and the government have ignored these safety concerns, a parliamentary panel has concluded.In a draft report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) saw the commercial establishments as a ?big hindrance? to evacuation plans. CISF handles airport security across the country.HT accessed the draft report that was taken up for adoption at the PAC meeting last week.The committee indicted the operators, Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) and the ministry of civil aviation for what it says was the ?unscientific commercial usage? of the space available for passengers, especially restaurants, retail outlets, duty-free complexes and executive lounges. ?The advice of security agencies is being overlooked for commercial interests,? the report said, while also deprecating ?the complicity? of the civil aviation ministry. ?Members of the committee felt that mishap or disaster could be foreseen given the present state of narrow lanes for movement of passengers?. According to the report, CISF director-general OP Singh raised the issues in letters to the civil aviation ministry but got no response. A delegation of 14 PAC members met Singh during a visit to the airport?s two passenger terminals on March 7.The CISF DG did not give a comment for this story. A ministry spokesperson too did not offer any comment on the PAC?s observations.The PAC also noted that it received feedback from air passengers association of India (APAI) that the experience of flyers is ?nightmarish?: services are expensive, lounges and restrooms are dirty, quality of food sub-par, food courts ill-managed, seating facility at lounges not adequate, and baggage handling counters are inconvenient.?The committee was told that though feedback forms are available, no action is taken on these suggestions/complaints. The committee deplores the laxity of MoCA (ministry of civil aviation) for not taking strict action against the operators in this regard.? The Delhi International Airport Private Ltd (DIAL) is a joint venture consortium led by the GMR Group.A DIAL spokesperson said the airport?s terminals were well within global aviation standards in terms of the proportion of area given out to commercial setups with respect to the overall size of the terminal. ?In the last six years, IGI airport has retained a stellar ranking in Airport Service Quality (ASQ). The airport serves as a model to most other airports in India and worldwide on parameters such as passenger amenities, user friendliness, accessibility, cleanliness, security, entertainment, retail offerings and various other aspects,? the spokesperson said. The two terminals, T1 and T3, serve more than 150,000 passengers every day with nearly 1,200 flights arriving or departing.HT has reported that the domestic terminal, T1, currently handles more passengers than it was designed for. The adoption of the report was deferred, according to sources, due to differences of opinion over the demand by a BJP MP that the panel should recommend a CBI inquiry into the alleged violations of the agreement between DIAL and the airport authority of India. The panel also criticised the airport operators for licensing out land around the terminals without making any study about the passenger movement, their accommodation needs and accessibility to the airport ?which is evident from a large number of hotels cropping up in the area and consequent illegal use of the licensed land for other purposes.? The delegation that visited the airport comprised chairman KV Thomas, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab and Congress MP Shantaram Naik, and 10 other parliamentariansThe panel also expressed reservation against the ?unethical? development fee on passengers, saying that they should not be made to pay for airport infrastructure that is the ?sole responsibility? of DIAL and its shareholders."

3585,Sachin should aid in cricket administration: BCCI panel head,"After the embarrassing loss of vote and face for Board of Cricket Control for India (BCCI) at the International Cricket Council (ICC) and left to deal with defiant office bearers, the head of BCCI Committee of Administrators (CAO) Vinod Rai urged legends of Indian cricket to speak up to ensure cricket administration improves. Rai was speaking at the launch of a biographical book of cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar. Closing his speech Rai addressing Tendulkar said, ""I think Indian cricket is once again at its peak, you would agree. We have a remarkable young team. They are aggressive, they are dedicated. Their commitment on the field is wonderful. We go to see these matches because cricketers perform remarkably on the ground. We need to ask ourselves if we are providing them with the right support in terms of logistics, administration. All that you must be reading in the newspapers is unfortunate and I don't think we are doing good service to the excellent team we have."" He went on to urge the former greats of Indian cricket to take a stand over administrative matters using their position of influence to clean the system. ""I would suggest that because of the fact that they deserve something far better, legends like Kapil (Dev), Sourav (Ganguly), Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar need to in some ways mentor these people and also speak up and ensure that cricket administration in this country improves.

3586,IAS officers to adopt martyred security personnel's families,"In a unique initiative, IAS officers will adopt families of security personnel, who lost their lives in Maoist combat, anti-terror operations or maintaining law and order.The bureaucrats will approach such families within their area of posting and offer themselves as facilitators to help them (families) get their dues like pension, gratuity or allotment of services like petrol pump, jobs etc, an association representing them said today. The officers, however, would not be providing any direct financial help to such families, it said. ""Their job would be to help the families get their dues from respective governments. They may also help the children in such families to get admission in a school,"" Sanjay Bhoosreddy, honorary secretary of Indian Civil and Administrative Service (Central) Association, said.The association represents all members of Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Initially, about 700 young officers, of past four batches--2012 to 2015--will be asked to adopt at least one family in the area of their posting.""Senior officers, or those from state civil services, can also adopt such families voluntarily,"" Bhoosreddy, a Joint-Secretary level IAS officer, said. The officers will oversee whether the support (both in cash and kind) pledged by the state or local governments have been provided to the family concerned. They will ensure that the children of the martyred soldiers continue getting good education and mentor them so that they can pursue the career of their choice based on their aptitude and talent, the association said.OFFICERS TO PROVIDE SCHEME-BASED BENEFITSThe officers will also see whether any benefits can be provided to them based on various schemes being run by the government like Skill India, Start-up India, Digital India etc. Bhoosreddy said the support system will cater to the families of central armed police forces like Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), those in Army and all others working with local police. ""The state governments have been asked to share with the association the details of such families,"" he said.The official noted that the IAS officers, who work as Sub Divisional Magistrates (SDM), District Magistrate (DM) and at other senior positions in state and Central governments, have immense influence on the local administrative machinery.He added that such an influence can be positively channelised to support and help the families of martyred soldiers in an effective and sustained manner.ALSO READ:"

3588,UK's top paid CEO's payout plunges by ?185 crore in a year,"Sir Martin Sorrell received  48m in remuneration last year as WPP, the marketing and advertising company he founded and runs, moved to curb the level of his future payouts to avoid further clashes with investors.Sorrell, who has been on the receiving end of a string of shareholder voting revolts at WPP?s annual meetings in recent years, received total pay, bonuses and incentive scheme payouts of  48.1m in 2016.The figure is 31.6% lower than the  70.4m he received in 2015, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, which was opposed by one-third of WPP shareholders at last year?s AGM. The payout, the last to be awarded under WPP?s controversial ?Leap? scheme, means Sorrell has received about  210m in total remuneration since 2012.WPP has introduced a less generous arrangement for Sorrell, which is expected to pay out  19m a year. It will be the subject of a binding vote at the company?s annual meeting in June.However, WPP said on Friday that it intended to tighten the policy further with a potential payout band of  14.9m to  19.2m maximum this year. From 2018, that will fall to between  18m and  13m as dividend equivalent payments are scrapped.The company has moved to stem further potential run-ins with investors at a time of renewed scrutiny of corporate Britain since the Brexit vote and the warning from Theresa May that she would curb boardroom excess. WPP?s chairman, Robert Quarta, appointed at last year?s annual meeting, also said planning to identify the successor to Sorrell, 72, had intensified.?Our succession planning process, which has always been rigorous, has become even more focused and detailed over the past year,? said Quarta, in WPP?s annual report published on Friday. ?Whether it happens in the near or distant future, when Sir Martin leaves his role as chief executive, we will have an exceptional team of potential candidates on the bench.?Sorrell shows no signs of slowing down, having celebrated the birth of another child on the day of the US presidential election last year. He has no plans to step aside and said, on the question of succession, that there is ?nothing to see here?. His pay has been a flashpoint in the past. In 2012, during what became known as the shareholder spring, nearly 60% of investors rejected his annual package for the previous year. Last year, Sorrell defended his remuneration, arguing that he had put three decades of his life into turning WPP from a maker of wire baskets into a global marketing business worth  22bn.?I?m not a Johnny-come-lately who picked a company up and turned it round [for a big payday],? he said. ?If it was one five-year plan and we buggered off, fine [to criticise my pay]. Over those 31 years ? I have taken a significant degree of risk. [WPP] is where my wealth is. It is long effort over a long period of time.?The question of a successor has exercised investors in recent years, with Guy Jubb, the former head of governance at Standard Life Investments, using his final appearance at a WPP annual meeting in 2015 to criticise the apparent ?Sorrellcentricity? at the company.Quarta, writing in the annual report, said there is a list of internal and external candidates who could take over.?As part of our continuous assessment of those individuals who might one day become chief executive of the group, we have invited a number of leaders within WPP companies to present to the board and attend board meetings,? he said. ?This exercise gives me greater confidence than ever in the strength of our people and their potential to succeed at the very top.?This internal pool is, of course, maintained alongside a constantly refined list of external candidates.?Quarta said internal candidates include those who report directly to Sorrell, as well as ?many who currently occupy the senior tier below?."
3589,Australian players reject Cricket Australia's new pay offer,"Australia's professional cricketers rejected a pay offer from the sport's governing body on Friday, saying the proposal was ""a win for cricket administrators but a loss for cricket"".The already protracted and sometimes rancorous negotiations between the players' union and Cricket Australia (CA) precede the expiry of the current five-year deal, which runs out at the end of June.CA released their proposal last month, offering large salary increases, particularly for women, but breaking with the 20-year model of a fixed percentage of revenue from the game going to the cricketers.That break and a number of other factors proved unacceptable to the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), who laid out a counter-proposal in a statement on Friday.""The ACA on behalf of Australia's cricketers has today rejected Cricket Australia's pay and conditions proposal,"" read a statement.""The ACA also expresses frustration that what should be a relatively simple and good faith negotiation has not proceeded in this way.""The fact that CA has, despite various attempts to do so, produced no logical reason to break the successful partnership model and longstanding relationship with players, leaves the players unclear as to CA's objectives."""

Following the incident, which left the DMRC red-faced, it has also issued strict guidelines to the contractors, who are handling electronic systems, such as LED screens at stations.These screens are used for advertisements and information dissemination.While there is no penalty in the Delhi Metro?s rulebook for this particular offence, the DMRC is now considering a specific penalty. ?For this case, the Delhi Police are working closely with us.

The upcoming consultation paper is expected to address issues like the number of subscribers that can be on-boarded during the trial period by a new operator, as also the duration for such network and service testing. Other issues could be whether the services can be given free of charge or not. The consultation paper on the issue is likely to be issued by May, two people familiar with the matter told PTI. It may be recalled that the cellular operators body COAI had, last year, alleged that the new entrant Reliance Jio was attempting to acquire customers by offering connection loaded with freebies, in the guise of a trial launch. Reliance Jio, in turn, accused incumbent players like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone of not releasing sufficient interconnection ports even during its test run of services. "

3607,Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme passes away at 73,"Film director Jonathan Demme, best known for The Silence of the Lambs and Something Wild, has died at the age of 73. His publicist told Variety that the cause of death was ?cancer complications?.The Silence of the Lambs, the horror-thriller adapted from Thomas Harris? novel, was the high point of his career as a mainstream film-maker: the film won five Oscars, including best director for Demme, and made its central character, Hannibal Lecter, into a household name.However, it was untypical of Demme?s career, both before and after its 1991 release. Having spent much of the 1960s living in London and working as a music writer, Demme cut his teeth in the no-budget school of Roger Corman: initially as a writer, then gaining his first directorial credit on the prison flick Caged Heat in 1974. (Its tag line: ?Women?s prison USA ? Rape Riot and Revenge! White Hot Desires melting cold prison steel!)After directing two other films for Corman, Demme found a niche in the burgeoning independent cinema scene with his 1980 film Melvin and Howard, a comedy about a former milkman who claims to be the heir of Howard Hughes. Later in the same decade, Demme completed the yuppie-in-peril comedy Something Wild, which gave Melanie Griffith one of her early successful roles.The Silence of the Lambs, he said later, ?was a great delirious shock to everybody concerned?, but he appeared to being disquieted by the controversies that accompanied it, and subsequently concentrated on films that reflected his own politically liberal credentials. Philadelphia, which starred Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance and brought Aids and gay characters into the mainstream. Meanwhile, Beloved, released in 1998, was an adaptation of Toni Morrison?s seminal novel about slavery.Alongside his feature film career, Demme indulged a taste for the odd, the eccentric and the underground. He made documentaries about Talking Heads (including Stop Making Sense, 1984), Neil Young (among them Heart of Gold, 2006) and his radical priest cousin (Cousin Bobby, 1992); he filmed Spalding Gray?s celebrated one-man show Swimming to Cambodia (1987), and shot a profile of US president Jimmy Carter (Man from Plains, 2007).His mainstream film-making took a dip in the 2000s, after the poorly received remake of Charade, The Truth About Charlie and a new version of The Manchurian Candidate, but he restored his reputation with the wedding comedy-drama Rachel Getting Married and the likable girl-rocker film Ricki and the Flash.Jodie Foster, who won an Oscar for her role in The Silence of the Lambs, released a statement earlier today. ?I am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you?d have to design a hurricane to contain him,? it read. ?Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy. Love him so much.? Meryl Streep, who took the title role in Ricki and the Flash, also released a statement to pay tribute to ?A big hearted, big tent, compassionate man?, while Tom Hanks called him ?the grandest of men?.Very sad to hear of the passing of the great Jonathan Demme. Admired his movies, his documentaries, his concert films. He could do anything.Film-makers such as Edgar Wright and James Wan have also paid tribute to Demme on Twitter, with Wright saying: ?Admired his movies, his documentaries, his concert films. He could do anything.?"
3608,World's oldest fungus discovered in South Africa,"London, Apr 26 (PTI) Scientists have discovered what may be the worlds oldest fungus in South African rocks dating back 2.4 billion years. The fossils suggest that fungus may have evolved from under the deep sea rather than land. Drilled from rocks that were once beneath the seafloor, the fossils resemble living fungi and could push back the date for the oldest fungi by one to two billion years. If not a fungus, the organism could be from an extinct branch of life that has not been described before, scientists say. ""The deep biosphere where the fossils were found represents a significant portion of the Earth, but we know very little about its biology and even less about its evolutionary history,"" said Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Sweden who led the research team. The fossils closely resemble those found in similar conditions on land. They are made up of jumbles of tangled threads some hundredths of a millimetre thick. There is a ""clear possibility"" that they are the worlds oldest fossil fungi - twice as old as generally accepted in the fossil record, Bengtson was quoted as saying by the BBC News. "
3609,No justification for pending appointment of Lokpal: SC,"The Supreme Court today said that the Lokpal bill is a ""workable piece of legislation"" and there is no justification to keep its implementation pending.The Supreme Court ruled that there was no justification to hold the Act in abeyance, and said there was no reason to delay the appointment of Lokpal.Prashant Bhushan-led NGO Common Cause had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on the pending appointment of Lokpal.Senior advocate Shanti Bhushan, appearing for NGO, argued that even though the Lokpal Bill was passed by Parliament in 2013 and came into effect in 2014, Lokpal has not been appointed by the government deliberately.Earlier, the Supreme Court had pulled up the Centre for not appointing the Lokpal expeditiously. NO LEADER OF OPPOSITIONAttorney General Mukul Rohatgi had told the Supreme Court that in the current scenario, Lokpal cannot be appointed as there was no clear Leader of Opposition.After the Narendra Modi government was elected to power in 2014, no party has the required 10 per cent of the House strength (545 seats) to qualify as the 'Leader of Opposition'. The Congress has 45 members in Lok Sabha.The law mandates that the Leader of Opposition is part of the selection process of Lokpal.The selection panel for Lokpal also comprises the Prime Minister, the Lok Sabha speaker, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) or a sitting Supreme Court judge nominated by the CJI, and an eminent jurist nominated by the President on the basis of recommendations made by the other members of the panel.

Later he met booth level party workers at chief minister Mamata Banerjee's Banwanipur constituency and went on a door-to-door campaign as part of BJP's massive outreach programme in Bengal.Attacking the state government over a host of issues, Shah was particularly vocal about Mamata's ""appeasement"" politics. ""The administration in Bengal has been communalised and that's why such (communal) incidents are taking place. If there was no appeasement this would not have be the case,"" Shah said in response to the spike in communal flare-ups in the state.He also added that no one from the TMC were in touch with BJP in response to the Trinamool supremo's allegation that BJP was trying to break her party using central agencies.On the issue of Gau Rakshaks, Shah said his party had given a clear message that no one should take law in their own hands. ""Cases have been registered and people are being arrested,"" Shah claimed.Responding to the  criticism that Sukma attack proved demonetisation has had no impact on the Maoists, as claimed by the Modi government earlier, Shah said, ""One can't judge the impact from just one incident.

3615,Give up PM ambitions: Ex-AAP leader urges Kejriwal,"Former Aam Aadmi Party leader and a close aide of party?s national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Mayank Gandhi has slammed the Delhi CM in an open letter on Wednesday as the BJP looked set to complete hat-trick of its rule in the three MCDs.The results of the MCD elections were announced on Wednesday with the AAP facing a rout. The letter, which Gandhi had posted on his blog and tweeted from his handle, addresses Kejriwal ? the Hero and the Politician. Gandhi described the AAP rout as a ?body blow to arrogance?.?Arvind, the unselfish hero who would never compromise, was dead. In his place was a politician who wanted to manipulate that support to fuel his ambition to become a PM in 2019,? Gandhi wrote, referring to direction AAP took after the unprecedented win in the 2015 assembly elections.?We have out beaten other parties with our arrogance and internal politicking,? Gandhi wrote.?You took complete power by becoming convener as well as CM of Delhi. How much more power do you want before you start delivering alternative politics?,? the former AAP leader wrote. ?Abandon the agenda of wanting to be another BJP and Cong. We had come to fight them not become another version of them,? Gandhi said.He advised Kejriwal to give up national ambitions and focus on Delhi. ?For now, forget your national ambitions and focus on governing Delhi well, that is your only chance of staying relevant. Stop dramas and blaming.?Here?s the full letter:Dear Arvind,A defeat deals a body blow to arrogance and makes the mind ready to reflect. So, the timing is appropriate.I am addressing you as your former friend and colleague who believes that AAP can still be salvaged and become the party for alternative politics. I am reaching out to you because my agony is not just mine; but of lakhs of volunteers, donors and supporters.We have known each other since 2003, when I was part of Annaji fast-to-death in Mumbai for the RTI etc. You have been my hero first, friend next and politician later.Let me address the hero firstI remember how you convinced me to get out of my spiritual pursuit and lead the IAC movement in Maharashtra when we met in Nov 2011 in a conference hosted by Bhagwanji Raiyani in SP Jain Institute, Mumbai. In spite of my reluctance, you announced my name. I respected you too much to decline.I remember in mid 2012, when we both were travelling in an auto in Aarey Colony that you told me to quit my job so that I could give full time to the Anna andolan. In spite of my precarious financial situation, I quit my job.I remember we used to discuss idealism in politics till late in the night whenever you stayed with us. My daughter, who was part of those discussions, got inspired to become an IRS like you. So, not just me, my entire family believed in your ideals.I remember that you sent Manish Sisodia to study the experiment that we, in Mumbai, were working on for a citizen consensus candidate for Juhu in 2009. We both were working on creating a model where political candidates could be elected without using money, muscle or divisive agenda i.e. without use of caste, communal, criminal or corrupt practices.That was exactly what AAP attempted in the 2013 and 2015 Delhi elections, successfully.I remember how we used to speak for hours about how the personality or high command driven politics of India was destroying the nation? be it Cong or the BJP or the Thackerays or the Laloo, Mayavati and Mulayam. You hated that, then!When I announced from the stage that you will remove the tubes if you were force fed during your Jantar Mantar fast, there were tears in my eyes along with many others in the audience. When I came to meet you in Delhi during your fast for electricity your health and determination completely shook me up. You refused to compromise. You would rather break than bend. Millions like me admired you and were willing to even give up their lives for you. You were our hero. Where is that Arvind?Like Anna, you were a symbol of the aspirations of an awakened nation. A symbol of the principles of Participation, Accountability, Transparency, Decentralization and Integrity. A symbol of the anger we all felt against the other parties that worked with the 4C (corruption, communalism, criminalization and casteism). AAP became a symbol of the fight of crores of our countrymen against the corrupt parties.In 2014 you resigned as CM of Delhi hoping that there would be immediate re-election and that AAP would sweep back to power on the back of 49 days of good, intense work. But BJP and Cong delayed the election and Modi swept to power in Parliament. To the worry of myself, Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Prithvi, Admiral Ramdas and others ? you started pushing all senior members to agree to form government with the Congress. We refused. You were really furious with us. You were still my hero, but by now I was getting worried with the way you were operating.Then the 2015 Delhi elections were announced. While you had around 5000 volunteers from Delhi working part-time with the candidates; I was part of the leadership of over 6000 volunteers from all over the country, campaigning full time for more than a month. The silent volunteers, the trusting donors, ardent supporters, tele-callers from Rural India to Global Indians contributed and even Yogendra Yadav who was our Chief Spokesperson contributed for AAP victory. What looked like a possible 15-20 seats to AAP suddenly became 67 seats.This is when you made THE classic mistake. You took the complete credit and felt that the support of the nation was for Arvind Kejriwal, the person. You assumed that you were the pied piper whom people were following, but in fact it was the music of a new political culture that had people enchanted.Arvind, the unselfish hero who would never compromise, was dead. In his place was a politician who wanted to manipulate that support to fuel his ambition to become a PM in 2019. You and your coterie decided1. You will be CM but not take any portfolio and focus outside Delhi trying to create a mahagatbandhan to challenge the PM, with you as the face.2. Use the MLAs and senior functionaries outside Delhi to try and win more states. The lack of governance in Delhi due to this fallout was to be blamed on the LG and Central Government.3. Erase the difference between private and public money. Use public money for personal advertising, personal expenditure, fly First class, fight personal cases and whenever this gets questioned ? point fingers at other parties.4. Win at any cost! If Swaraj comes in the way ? throw it away. If appeasement works ? do it. If caste politics gets you the votes ? embrace it. If too many questions are asked ? remove the donation list. If money is required, sell seats. Power is more important than principles.5. Project Kejriwal as a strong leader. Personally attack Modi at every instance so that you would appear like a daring contestant and be able to create a vote bank of anti-Modi votes.6. To further look like a strong leader, remove anyone and everyone from the party that has a differing point of view. As Ashutosh told me ? there should be one voice only in the party and anyone opposing should be dealt in a manner that would give a message that this party deals summarily with anyone who opposes the supremo.As a part of the above strategy, you began by removing Yogendra and Prashant from the party with the worst possible humiliation.When I was told that there was a gag order on informing the volunteers outside, I asked myself, ?What would the real Arvind Kejriwal have done?? He would have listened to his conscience. So I did. I had to inform the lakhs of AAP volunteers about what happened in that crucial meeting, in spite of the gag order. I had the courage of conviction and was ready to be removed from the party. For me, Truth was non-negotiable.You took time to remove me. And in spite of repeated requests to not punish the superb Maharashtra team to spite me, you threw out the entire Maharashtra AAP committees down to the lowest rung in Oct 2015. Can Modi or Sonia remove an entire State team with just an edict? We have out beaten other parties with our arrogance and internal politicking. The other day, a young volunteer with tears in his eyes from rural Maharashtra asked me, ?What is our fault?? What do I tell him, Arvind? Why was he removed?Personally, I have closely seen my friend, hero and someone as precious as you become so vicious and ugly because of hunger for power. I have now become afraid of power. That is why I did not join any group or party after you removed me from the primary membership of the party using the dirtiest and filthiest falsehood.I remember in one volunteer meeting in Santacruz where we had a public argument. You felt that we should not give any importance to volunteers, they were just tools. I publicly contradicted you saying that these were some of the finest humans who had sacrificed for the nation. They are NOT pawns to be used?and-thrown.Look around you almost all of the original volunteers who had left everything to join for the principles have been removed, quit or are inactive.In our scheme of things our volunteers were supposed to be the primary unit of the party so I ask on their behalf. How did you select Ashutosh, Ashish Khetan and others in the national team? Why has no internal election taken place? When is the donation list coming back on the website? Who is accountable for the loss in Punjab, Goa and now Delhi, were the volunteers asked or informed? The questions are innumerable but let us ask with these basic ones.You took complete power by becoming convener as well as CM of Delhi. How much more power do you want before you start delivering alternative politics? In your pursuit for power, you have betrayed my beloved nation. You have messed up the life of millions who followed you. They gave you complete power ?made you convener and CM. Delhi gave you 67 seats just two years back. What more do you want? I do not know whether you know the reality or are living in denial - but are a very unpopular man in the country. If you do more drama, then it is going to get worse and we cannot afford that. Dear Arvind, I have seen you turn 180 degrees from what you were. After your complete rejection in Punjab, Goa and now in Delhi, can I expect you to introspect and make another 180 degree turn? Abandon the agenda of wanting to be another BJP and Cong. We had come to fight them not become another version of them. Follow our original agenda that might get back the respect and credibility that you have completely lost with your foolish and vote bank oriented comments. Get back credible and independent people in the core team. For now, forget your national ambitions and focus on governing Delhi well, that is your only chance of staying relevant. Stop dramas and blaming. We still need the principles; we still need to fight corrupts; we still need to fight against criminalization of politics. We still need to fight against caste and communal politics. The parties that use these tools are still around. Our AAP was formed to fight that. But, for that, AAP needs to transform. Do you have the strength, integrity and love for the country to genuinely reboot? With all humility, can I request you to let go of your arrogance and ego for the good of the country? Remember nation first, party next and individuals last. The country needs heroes. Are you one? The battle is between your Ego and the nation. What will you choose?LoveMayank. "

Manjit Kaur, a sub-inspector in the Punjab Police, tied a knot with a woman and it wasn't a hush-hush affair. Jalandhar's Pucca Bagh witnessed a big fat same-sex wedding.While the cop wore a red turban, her bride rode a chariot. The marriage was solemnised according to the Hindu rituals, as reported by The Tribune. Reportedly, the wedding took place in the presence of their families, many classmates and colleagues of Manjit too were present at the ceremony.This is not the first time that a same-sex couple has gotten married. In fact, India has its very own gay marriage bureau.  Benhur Samson, an NRI, established India's first avenue where gays can find their soulmates in 2016. The bureau helps them find the right match, both within and outside the country. Samson started the arranged gay marriage service when he received numerous requests from gays regarding prospective life partners. Till 2013, he used to help gays with surrogacy. According to figures submitted by the government to the Supreme Court in 2012, there are 25 lakh gay people in India. Perhaps, it is time the Supreme Court goes ahead and takes a progressive step and decriminalises homosexuality. Also read: "

Three-foot Simon died in the cargo section of a Boeing 767 after flying out of Heathrow to a new celebrity owner in the US, The Sun reported. Simon was expected to outgrow his father Darius, whose length of 4ft 4 inches made him the worlds biggest bunny. ""He was as fit as a fiddle.

Ive sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before,"" Edwards said. ""The client who bought Simon is very famous. Hes upset,"" she said. Simon, a continental giant rabbit, was 10-months-old. Continental giants cost 5,000 pounds a year to keep. Edwards rabbits are hired out at 500 pounds a time. United Airlines said, ""We are reviewing this matter"". An airport source was quoted as saying that the news of Simons demise sparked panic among United Airlines staff. ""After the viral video, no-one wanted responsibility for killing what was to be the worlds biggest rabbit,"" the source said, referring to the controversy United Airlines was embroiled in after a passenger was forcibly removed from plane earlier this month.

3622,Air India plane grounded after being hit by catering van,"In a freak incident, which delayed the Air India flight by an hour, a catering van hit the door of an ATR aircraft at Delhi?s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) on Sunday morning. Air India officials are assessing the damage and said that the loss will run into lakhs and the aircraft will also remain grounded till it is repaired.?The catering vehicle was returning after loading the food in the aircraft. While returning, it accidentally hit the back door on right side just 20 minutes before the departure. The driver was taken for medical checkup but he was not drunk. His airport driving permit has been seized by the airport operator,? said an airport source.About 70 passengers, who were to fly to Gorakhpur by the aircraft, and were ready to board, had to wait for another hour. The flight, which was scheduled to take off at 9:45 am, took off at 10:45 am. The passengers were shifted to a different aircraft.?The vehicle hit the service gate and it is completely damaged now. Our engineering team is assessing the damage and will have to order the parts. We might have to import some parts. Till the door is repaired, we will manage the operations by tweaking the schedule,? the official added.The vehicle was of a ground handling company. No police case has been filed but an internal enquiry is being conducted since at the airside, vehicles allowed to move at a certain speed and in most of the occasions, they are asked to seek direction from follow me vehicle."
3623,Accidental damage to Yamuna already restored by nature: AOL,"A scientific report prepared by Art of Living claimed that any ?accidental damage? to the ecology of the Yamuna floodplains caused by the Art of Living?s cultural event in 2016 has already been restored by nature.This contradicts the earlier findings by the National Green Tribunal-appointed seven-member expert committee, which claimed that it would take at least 10 years and Rs42 crore to fix the physical and biological damages caused to the river?s floodplains by the event.?If at all any such accidental damage would have taken place during the event, in all probability they have already been reversed by natural processes. With the arrival of monsoon in 2016, all the lost plants and animals would have re-colonised the event site,? the foundation?s report has claimed. Instead the NGO report has hinted that removal of shrubs, tall grasses, aquatic vegetation and reeds from the event site, which the NGT panel had dubbed as harmful to the floodplains, is actually beneficial to the ecology as it also helped remove invasive exotic species such as water hyacinth.Experts from both the NGT?s panel and the foundation?s team refused to comment on this ongoing war between scientists and experts of the two panels. Art of Living had filed a 200-page parallel report in the NGT to counter the allegations levelled against it. The foundation, founded by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, which has been in the centre of controversy, had roped in at least 15 experts to prepare a scientific report. Experts in the Art of Living?s panel also alleged that satellite images, which forms one of the main pillars of the report submitted by the NGT-appointed panel, has been misinterpreted. The NGT panel had used satellite images and ground reports while claiming that large tracts of wetlands and water bodies were filled up for the event. ?One of the most glaring mistakes made in the report is the declaration of dry farmlands as huge tract of wetlands filled with water and several water bodies etc. Even the agricultural crops have been considered as wetland vegetation with shallow to deep water beneath them,? the NGO?s report has claimed. The experts pointed out that even the Survey of India?s report and National Wetland Atlas prepared by Space Application Centre have no mention of any such wetlands. The atlas had listed around 399 wetlands, including 301 micro wetlands in Delhi alone. The foundation?s report has also challenged the NGT-panel?s allegations that nearly 420 acres of Yamuna floodplains were damaged. Experts questioned how can an event, held over 25 acres of land, damage 420 acres of floodplains.The NGT panel had accused the foundation of levelling and compacting the soil resulting in heavy damage to the floodplains as it stopped the soil?s gaseous exchange and played havoc with the ground water recharging system. Experts who prepared the foundation?s report, however, claimed that compaction if any was done much earlier when construction of guide banks, DND and Barapullah drain were going on. ?It is impossible for even a practicing geophysicist to claim that ground was levelled or compacted without a geophysical study,? says the reports.

3624,Won't tolerate such incidents: CM Raje on Alwar lynching,"Almost a month after the murder and lynching of 55-year-old Pehlu Khan, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has broken her prolonged silence on the heinous act.Raje said that police has arrested some people and that her government will not tolerate these of kind of incidents in Rajasthan.Raje's response comes a day after about 23 former IAS officer's wrote an open letter to her condemning the incident and demanding justice for Pehlu Khan.""We are very disturbed by the lynching and murder of Pehlu Khan in Alwar.

3625,AIADMK's TTV Dinakaran arrested over charges of bribing EC,"AIADMK Amma leader TTV Dinakaran, who is accused of bribing an Election Commission official to get the AIADMK's frozen ' two leaves' symbol for his faction of the party, has been arrested by Delhi Police's Crime Branch. His longtime friend Mallikarjuna has also been taken into custody.On Tuesday, Dinakaran was questioned for a fourth consecutive day by Delhi Police. He reached the Crime Branch Inter State Cell office in Chanakyapuri at 5 PM. He was arrested after being questioned for close to six hours, Praveer Ranjan, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), said. Dinakaran has been interrogated for a total of 37 hours, and will be produced at Tiz Hazari Court this afternoon after a medical test at Safdarjung Hospital.  DINAKARAN ADMITS HE MET SUKESH Dinakaran has admitted to meeting Sukesh Chandrasekhar, under the impression that he was a high court judge, police said on Monday. At the same time, he denied having paid any money to Sukesh  in an attempt to obtain the AIADMK's symbol for his camp, police said. Until Monday, Dinakaran had maintained that he didn't know Sukesh, and that he hadn't met him.  Police have also questioned Dinakaran's personal assistant Janardhana in connection with the case.  Sources said he has agreed to be a witness. WHY WAS MALLIKARJUNA ARRESTED? Mallikarjuna was arrested for allegedly facilitating the deal between Dinakaran and Sukesh Chandrasekar, Praveer Ranjan said.Mallikarjuna had been accompanying Dinakaran everywhere ever since Sukesh was arrested on April 16 for allegedly striking a deal of Rs 50 crore to help the AIADMK (Amma) faction keep the poll symbol.Dinakaran, Mallikarjuna and Chandrasekar will be questioned together to establish the money trail, details of the deal and whether more people were involved in it.  CHANDRASEKAR'S CUSTODY EXTENDED On Tuesday, the police produced Chandrasekar before a special court, which extended his custody till April 28. The court was told that Chandrasekar had been paid through hawala channels. ""A person named Shah Faisal told that he had collected a parcel from Chennai and gave it to Chandrasekar, who had posed as a member of Parliament,"" the police said. It is suspected that the parcel contained Rs 10 crore. The police said three Chandni Chowk-based hawala operators will also be questioned in connection with the case. AIADMK REVOLT Dinakaran's arrest comes at a time when there are moves to merge the two factions of the AIADMK - the AIADMK Puratchi Thalaivi Amma led by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, and the AIADMK Amma, led by incumbent CM Edappadi Palaniswami (and to which Dinakaran, too, belongs).Dinakaran was in February appointed the AIADMK's deputy general secretary by jailed party chief V S Sasikala - who happens to be his aunt. However, a powerful section of the AIADMK Amma recently revolted against the Sasikala-Dinakaran leadership.That happened after Panneerselvam demanded the ouster of Sasikala and Dinakaran as a condition for the merger.Dinakaran later announced he would stay away from party affairs, and that he could be removed only by Sasikala.Sasikala is currently serving a four-year jail term in Bengaluru in a disproportionate assets case.(Inputs from PTI) ALSO READ | TTV Dinakaran confesses to meeting middleman in EC bribery case, assumed he was high court judge"

The department, as part of a special investigation and audit into the account books of AVL, found that an income of over Rs 48,000 crore for a particular assessment year was allegedly not reflected in the record books of the firm and hence it raised a fresh tax demand and penalty amount on it. A Sahara Group spokesperson confirmed the development to PTI. ""Yes, the Income Tax Department has raised Rs 48,085.79 crores to the income of the Aamby Valley Limited with a total demand of income tax of Rs 24,646.96 crores on the Aamby Valley Limited,"" the spokesperson said in a brief statement. Officials said the notice was issued by the taxman in January this year after the special audit of AVLs income for the Assessment Year 2012-13 found that the parent firm had allegedly floated a clutch of Special Purpose Vehicles whose incomes were later accounted on the account of AVL as they were merged with the former in due course of time. The AVL, in its income return filed for AY 2012-13, had reflected a loss of few crores but the special I-T audit brought up the added income, a senior official said. The Supreme Court, last week, had asked the Bombay High Courts official liquidator to sell the Rs 34,000 crore worth of properties of Aamby Valley owned by the Sahara Group and directed its chief Subrata Roy to personally appear before it on April 28.

The BJP leader, who was confident of a good show by his party in the MCD polls, the results of which will be declared tomorrow, said the civic bodies needed to be ""revamped"" in order to deliver the services to the people more effectively. The first thing needed was a discussion on the unification of the three municipal corporations and there should also be an end to the practice of sending Delhi government officials to serve in the civic bodies, said the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports. ""Barring one, the two other civic bodies have been incurring losses. It would be more fruitful and efficient if all the three were merged,"" he said, referring to the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations. The erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated into NDMC, SDMC and EDMC by the then Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government in 2012.

Hall of Nations and Industry. Next to come under the hammer is Nehru Pavilion. Indian trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) razed the structures two days after their architect Raj Rewal lost the case in Delhi high court on April 20. Conservationists are perplexed as the demolition took place as one petition by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to save these structures is still being heard in the same court with next hearing slated for May 1.ITPO is setting up a world-class Integrated Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre (IECC) with project value of Rs2,254 crore.

AGK Menon, former convener, Delhi Chapter INTACH said, ?It?s all over now. As the ITPO did not wait for the court to pronounce its decision, we have lost all hope. Hall of Nations was demolished quietly on Sunday night when the entire world slept. As these iconic buildings no more exist, we cannot move the apex court.?

The case was being heard in the Delhi high court and the hearings were scheduled on April 27 and May 1, 2017.??In fact as an answer to our letter to the Prime Minister, the ministry of commerce indicated to us to find an amicable resolution with the trade fair authority. But obviously somebody in the ITPO had other motives,? the statement said. In a written statement, ITPO CMD LC Goyal said the execution of IECC requires dismantling of Hall No. 1 to 6, 14 to 20 and state pavilions, including Hall of Nations, Nehru Pavilion and Hall of Industry ? which he claimed are not classified as heritage buildings.?Earlier a PIL and two writ petitions filed by India Institute of Architects in Court of Delhi were dismissed. Presently, a writ petition filed by INTACH is pending in the high court of Delhi. The high court on April 20, 2017, has dismissed another writ petition filed by Raj Rewal seeking to declare and preserve Hall of Nations, Hall of Industry and Nehru Pavilion as work of art of national importance. An appeal has been filed against the dismissal, but there is no stay granted by the court in any of the writ petitions against demolition of structures envisaged in the re-development of Pragati Maidan,? Goyal said. Goyal said the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) has maintained that only those buildings which are at least 60 years old can be considered for inclusion in the heritage list."

3640,BJP leader calls Mamata 'Babur' for renaming Centre's scheme,"The Didi vs Modi battle has gone a notch higher with the Mamata Banerjee government changing the names of the Central government schemes in West Bengal. The Trinamool Congress has been a vocal critic of the BJP government at the Centre, and has lashed out at the Centre for its decision to demonetise high-value currency in November last year.The Mamata Banerjee government wants to drop the 'Pradhan Mantri' from the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and instead wants to call it 'Banglar Gramin Sadak Yojana'.Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Grameen is now 'Banglar Griha Prakalpa'.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) will be known in West Bengal as 'Mission Nirmal Bangla'. Hitting out at the Mamata government for renaming schemes, BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose compared the West Bengal chief minister to Babur who ""demolished a temple in Ayodhya and built Babri Masjid"".STATE IS BEARING THE COST TOOThe reason for renaming schemes: The Mamata Banerjee government said that the state has to now bear 40 per cent of the total cost of implementing the schemes as against 10 per cent previously. According to the West Bengal government, if the state has to pay more than 40 per cent of the total cost then why should the Central government get the credit, especially when the state is providing the machinery and agency for the implementation of the scheme.   P Ulagnathan, district magistrate of Cooch Behar confirmed that he has received the orders and said he would ""implement"" them.  Pushpita Roy Dakua, who is the sabhadipati of Cooch Behar zila parishad, said the work on changing the names of schemes on boards and banners is on at war-footing.

He called the trend ""unethical"".BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose while comparing Mamata Banerjee to Babur said, ""Babur demolished the temple in Ayodhya and built Babri Masjid. Similarly, Mamata Banerjee is demolishing and changing the names of central schemes"".""I think it is very foolish of Mamata Banerjee to change names and give a name at the state level for the same scheme which the Centre has actually adopted,"" the BJP leader said, adding that his party would ""expose her (Mamata) bluff in the next election"".ALSO READ:At NITI Aayog meet, PM Narendra Modi presents New India vision, Kejriwal, Mamata not interested"

Indian and Pakistani hackers also fought pitched battles in cyber space after last September's terrorist attack on a military camp in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector.A message on a hacked Pakistani website read, ""Charges against Kulbhushan Jadhav are fictitious, fake and farcical. There is no evidence of wrong doing by him. This is an act of ""premeditated murder'. Earlier it was Sarabjeet, now it's Jadhav.""GROUP OF 11 HACKERS TAKE RESPONSIBILITYResponsibility of hitting the websites was taken by ""lulzsec India"", comprising 11 hackers. Experts say many nations are deploying cyber warriors to attack vital organizations in enemy countries. Pakistan, China, Iran and North Korea have deployed hackers by granting them immunity from consequences.Another hackers' group, Telangana Cyber Warrior, claims it has infected the network of a government hospital in Karachi. ""We have their entire computer network under our control. We can modify patients' records and monitor their health condition,"" said a member of the group.The Kerala Cyber Warriors hacked the website of Pakistan Academy for Rural Development.

They have in the past carried out mass defacement and are focused on targeting government portals. State police websites were defaced by Pakistani hackers where they posted anti-India comments with an image of the Pakistan flag.Experts say the intelligence-gathering process has intensified as hackers are not only defacing the sites but are silently spying into critical networks.Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested reportedly from Balochistan after he entered Pakistan from Iran. He was accused by Pakistan of being a ""RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) agent"" and planning ""subversive activities"" in the country. The Indian government, on the other hand, believed that he was picked up from Iran.India has acknowledged Jadhav as a retired Indian Navy officer, but denied that he was in any way connected to the government.ALSO READ | Who is Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian sentenced to death in Pakistan?"

HT has a copy of the modified syllabus.Teachers have been asked to send their feedback by May 1.The recommendations will now be placed at the Academic Council and Executive Council for approval before being implemented in the new session.Teachers at DU gave mixed reaction over the development. While some raised objection with the way the syllabus has been modified, others said it makes sense to include novels which students might have read.?There is some sense to add these novels as students might have read them already and have seen movie adaptations. It gives an opportunity to do an informed critique of the text,? said Sanam Khanna, who teaches English at DU.Sachin N, who teaches English at Dyal Singh College, said, ?The way these modifications have been done has limited or no participation from teachers. There is no framework on how we are supposed to teach the popular fiction paper. The core committee has no statutory recognition. We used to have general body meeting of teachers before suggesting changes but that doesn?t happen anymore.?Another teacher said on condition of anonymity, ?There are other popular fictions available, why Bhagat?

And then she will get concert offers from Canada, and then probably Sonakshi will laugh them off saying 'I am not a singer but an actor',"" Kailash said, over phone from Mumbai about Sonakshi, who made her debut as a singer in 2015 with single Ishqholic, and also judged singing reality show, Indian Idol Junior.He added, ""Whenever any singer from the West comes to India, we get an actor on board to match their level. We don't get singer for another singer, but actor... Event managers and producers of entertainment industry are so scared.""The actress will perform as one of the opening acts at the highly anticipated gig, which will be held at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai on May 10.The Indian award-winning singer feels people tend to give more value to actors instead of singers in India.""Live performances are thought to be more valuable around the world, not actors, but not in India... Indians are very emotional and that is why sometimes they miss out on logic while watching a live gig.""""The organisers don't consider crowd's sensibilities (while deciding on the acts in a live gig), and only go for a popular face. Often actors just come and say 'It is nice to be here'.""Be it for his work in the music industry or association with government initiatives or his endeavours to promote homegrown talent and live musicians, Kailash has expanded his horizon, and earned critical acclaim from all quarters.Hailing from Meerut, Kailash rose to fame after years of struggle in terms of finding shelter in a new city like Mumbai and hardships due to cash crunch. After starting with advertisement jingles, he got his big break with the song, Allah Ke Bande.He carved a niche for himself with his rustic voice with hits like, Ya Rabba, Chak De Phatte and Tere Naal Ishqa. Kailash also gave chartbusters from albums like Teri Deewani, Saiyyan and Chaandan Mein.Kailash, who makes it a point to promote live musicians through his tours, rues the plummeting standard of live gigs in India.The 43-year-old said, ""It is our choice. We can reduce our live tours, there is no need to keep a band and be more hero-type and work for films... I always wanted to do live music and to promote it through concerts.""""If we keep on seeing shows by actors, it will be so sad because live musicians won't be able to survive,"" added the singer, who performed at the Phoenix Marketcity, Kurla in Mumbai, in March."
3649,"Telcos to bleed this fiscal as well due to Jio, says Crisil","Mumbai, Apr 24 (PTI) Telecos will continue to face difficulties in fiscal 2018 as well and two of the top three telcos are set to ""bleed"" due to intense competition triggered after the launch of Reliance Jio, a report said today. ""The price war in the Rs 1.5-trillion wireless telecom market will continue this fiscal year as well leaving bruised bottom lines,"" Crisils said in a note today. ""Two of the top three telecom players will bleed this fiscal,"" it added. It attributed the difficulties faced by the sector to the price war for data subscribers, but added market leadership is crucial to the business and if anything, competition will only heat up this year. The note explained that global experiences have shown that the market leader enjoys superior profitability. The report said two of the top three telcos will end last fiscal year with net losses, and this trend is expected to continue in the current fiscal year as well. Since its launch last September offering free services for almost six months, Jio is estimated to have cornered 55 per cent of total data consumption, while the overall data traffic has grown five times in the last one year, it said. ""A 60 per cent fall in 4G data prices since launch of Jio has resulted in muted 2 per cent growth in adjusted gross revenue last fiscal year,"" the report said. "
3650,Not looking someone in the eye is racist: Oxford to students,"London, Apr 24 (PTI) Oxford University students who avoid making eye contact with their peers could be guilty of racism, according to the prestigious varsitys latest guidance. The universitys Equality and Diversity Unit has advised undergraduate students that ""not speaking directly to people"" could be deemed a ""racial micro-aggression"" which can lead to ""mental ill-health"", The Telegraph reported. Issued at the start of the Trinity term, the third term at the university, the newsletter claims that asking someone where they are ""originally"" from implies they are a foreigner. It also claims that ""jokes drawing attention to someones differences"" and ""not speaking directly to people"" are potential forms of ""everyday racism"". The universitys Equality and Diversity Unit explains in the newsletter that ""some people who do these things may be entirely well-meaning, and would be mortified to realise that they had caused offence."" ""But this is of little consequence if a possible effect of their words or actions is to suggest to people that they may fulfil a negative stereotype, or do not belong,"" it states. However, some critics slammed the newsletter, saying it would make the students over sensitive. Dr Joanna Williams, a lecturer in higher education at the University of Kent, said the guidance was ""completely ridiculous"" and will make students ""hyper-sensitive"" about how they interact with one another. ""Essentially people are being accused of a thought crime. They are being accused of thinking incorrect thoughts based on an assumption of where they may or may not be looking,"" she said. Williams, who is author of Academic Freedom in an Age of Conformity, said that Oxford Universitys guidance was ""overstepping the mark"" by telling students ""how they should feel and think"". Tom Slater, co-coordinator of The Free Speech University Ranking project that highlights censorship on university campuses, called it ridiculous to suggest that not looking someone in the eye was a micro form of racism. ""This is all part of a chilling desire on the part of university authorities to police not just opinions, but everyday conversations between students,"" he told The Times. An Oxford University spokesman was quoted as saying that, ""The Equality and Diversity Unit works with University bodies to ensure that the Universitys pursuit of excellence goes hand in hand with freedom from discrimination and equality of opportunity.""

This is how horribly wrong online shopping can go. Imagine you order a mobile from an online shopping site and get a brick in return. Well, that's what happened to a student based in Chennai when she ordered a mobile phone on Snapdeal.Also Read: iPhone 6 for Rs 25,660, iPhone 5S for Rs 17,499 as Flipkart kicks off Apple Days saleNithila Devi and her friend Ramya spent Rs 12,000 to buy a brand new Lenovo Z Plus phone on the site. After waiting for 3 days, they found that their order has arrived, although they asked the delivery guy to bring it next day because they were not available. Later the excited girls ripped open the cover and guess what they found? a brick. ""We couldn't pick up our parcel the day it arrived so we asked the delivery person to bring it the next day. When we opened the box, we were shocked to find half a brick inside,' said Ramya, a student in IIT Madras.The girls immediately called the delivery boy who said he had no clue and asked them to call Snapdeal. According to Ramya, ""As soon as we opened the package, we contacted the delivery person and he said he can't take it back.

3653,Luxury shoe retailer Jimmy Choo puts itself up for sale,"The luxury shoe and bag retailer Jimmy Choo has put itself up for sale in a move that took the market by surprise.The retailer said it had ?decided to conduct a review of the various strategic options open to the company to maximise value for its shareholders? and that it was seeking offers for the business.The move was backed by the company?s independent directors and JAB Luxury, its majority shareholder with a stake of 68%.Shares in Jimmy Choo jumped 10% to a record high of 186.25p on the news, valuing the group at more than  720m. The company floated on the stock market in 2014 at a price of 140p a share, valuing it at about  550m.Any sale is expected to attract interest from strategic American buyers as well as Middle Eastern, Chinese and Russian bidders.The company was founded in London in 1996 by the Malaysian fashion designer Jimmy Choo and the then Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. It runs 150 stores around the world, opening 10 last year as well as refitting 16 shops.It recently reported operating profits of  42.5m for 2016, up nearly 43%, after success with luxury trainers. Men?s shoes remain its fastest-growing category and account for 9% of revenue.The company has benefited from the drop in sterling since the EU referendum and is expanding in China. It has fared better than other luxury retailers such as Burberry, which were hit by Chinese tourists cutting back on luxury purchases.JAB, an investment company owned by Germany?s billionaire Reimann family, wants to sell its stake in the shoes group to focus on food and other consumer goods. The family, one of Europe?s wealthiest business dynasties, has been building an empire of coffee brands and last year added Krispy Kreme Doughnuts to its portfolio. It also owns the US cosmetics brand Coty. Luxury investments make up less than 10% of JAB?s portfolio, and it plans to use the sale proceeds to take on the likes of Nestl .A Euromonitor analyst said: ?Globally, retail sales of men?s designer footwear have grown marginally faster than women?s designer footwear over the last three years. So it is easy to see why Jimmy Choo has expanded into this male segment. Women?s luxury footwear still generates almost twice the retail value of men?s luxury footwear, though, and that disparity is unlikely to narrow significantly over the next decade.?But Jimmy Choo needs to be careful not to get ahead of itself. Remember what happened to Mulberry, another niche British luxury brand, when it drifted too far from its comfort zone? One year sales were soaring, the next they were dropping amidst a spate of profit warnings.?"

Tamil Nadu farmers, who have been protesting at Jantar Mantar in Delhi for past 41 days demanding drought relief package, today called off their strike till May 25 after assurance from Chief Minister E Palaniswamy.This is not the first time that the minister is in news for his insensitive remarks about farmer suicides.

3657,BJP may win 202-220 seats in MCD polls: Exit Poll,"The Bharatiya Janata Party is poised for a third consecutive term in Delhi municipal corporations with a brute majority, an exit poll conducted by India Today-Axis My India has predicted. The survey places the Aam Aadmi Party, which rules Delhi assembly, and the Congress trailing behind with a huge margin.Of the total 272 wards in the national Capital, the BJP is expected to win 202-220 seats while AAP and Congress 23-35 and 19-31 respectively, according to the poll survey. The voting percentage reflected in the polls give 43 per cent share to the saffron outfit while the AAP and Congress are almost equally placed at 24 and 23 per cent in the MCDs.The BJP lead is evenly spread in all three wards. The North MCD, which has 104 wards, is expected to give the BJP 78-84 seats, with AAP and Congress getting 8-12 each. Similarly, the 104-seat North MCD gives the BJP 79-85 seats. The AAP is placed somewhere between 9 and13 wards while the Congress at 7-11.The smaller East MCD, which has 64 wards, is expected to give the BJP 45-51 seats while the Congress 4-8 and the AAP 6-10.'POLL RESULTS ACCORDING TO OUR EXPECTATIONS'""Exit poll results are according to our expectations,"" state BJP president Manoj Tiwari told Mail Today. Attributing the positive survey results to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tiwari said, ""PM Modi has won hearts of people from sections of society. The BJP has taken all its decisions for welfare of India while the AAP has looted citizens of Delhi.""Tiwari said exit polls results prove while the Congress has lost ground across the nation, there is simmering discontent and anger among Delhi electorate against CM Kejriwal.The survey results also indicate that the BJP has made new inroads in the national Capital, with the last-minute change in state leadership with an extra emphasis on poorvanchali voters having paid off rich dividends. The exit poll has predicted that 45 per cent of the poorvanchali vote went in favour of BJP.This section of voters was a key target of the party when they handed over the reins of city unit to Manoj Tiwari in November last year.The recent by-election results in Rajouri Garden assembly segment too proved this when the BJP's poll percentage in the constituency increased from 38 per cent in 2015 to 52 per cent in 2017. The seat saw a sharp decline of nearly 34 per cent in the vote share of incumbent AAP from 47 per cent in 2015 to 13.1 in 2017. In previous several elections, the party's vote share had remained between 30 and 35 per cent in the national Capital.While AAP leaders were quick to point out anomalies in electronic voting machines, they were at pains to explain how an exit poll survey, which is gauged out of speaking to a voter exiting the election booth, can be linked with faulty EVMs.Congress leaders advised patience till April 26 when the counting occurs. ""These (polls) violate moral code of conduct. The results will come on 26. Let us wait till then,"" Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed said. The exit polls also indicate that the BJP has succeeded in making a dent in SC/ST and OBC votes in the national Capital. Apart from 54 per cent upper cast votes, the BJP is also expected to get 41 per cent of the SC/ST votes and 29 per cent OBC voters that are also considered the traditional vote bank of the Congress and the AAP.In 2012, the BJP bagged nearly 22 per cent of votes collectively in the three municipal corporations. In north MCD, the party polled 22.2 per cent, in South MCD 17.65 per cent and East 35 per cent.ALSO READ | MCD election 2017: Voting concludes, 53.58 per cent overall turnout"

3660,NOTA introduced for the first time in MCD elections,"Delhi residents will vote in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections today. The result of the poll is bound to have an impact beyond the borders of the capital.With AAP, Congress and BJP in the fray for the crucial polls, the national capital witnessed an aggressive campaign.The election will determine if Arvind Kejriwal's AAP will retain power in Delhi. AAP made inroads in the 2015 Assembly polls by winning 67 seats out of 70.The BJP, meanwhile, has fielded new candidates across the 267 wards. Earlier this week, the party had expelled one of its candidate from Narela for allegedly involving sacked AAP minister Sandeep Kumar in the campaign.The Congress, which finished second in the Rajouri Garden bypoll, is hoping for a resurgence and banked on its big guns during campaigns to shore up its fortune, despite unabated infighting. It has fielded 271 candidates.GOING STRONG DESPITE LOSSESThe AAP, which suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent bypolls and still smarting under its poor performance in Punjab and Goa polls, has refused to acknowledge the results as a ""trailer of MCD polls"".While the BJP's move to field new candidates was seen as a strategy to counter anti-incumbency, the party claims it was to ""give opportunity to the next generation"".The BJP is betting big on the contest. Addressing booth-level workers during campaigning, party chief Amit Shah had said a favourable verdict in the MCD polls could be a stepping stone to victory in the next Assembly elections in the city.The erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was trifurcated in 2012 into North, South and East Municipal Corporations. While NDMC and SDMC have 104 wards each, EDMC has 64.There are 1,004 candidates vying for seats in the NDMC area, 985 in SDMC's and 548 in EDMC's.

The SP today said it has 30 candidates altogether but two of them have died.TUSSLE OVER EVM CONTINUESThe Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India is also in the fray. The run-up to the polls have also been dominated by allegations of tampered EVMs - a charge made by Kejriwal, but rejected by the Election Commission.The Generation-1 electronic voting machines (EVMs) are to be used for the MCD elections, which the Commission has described as ""foolproof"". The State Election Commission is gearing up to carry out the electoral exercise that will be spread over 13,000 booths spanning 272 wards.Over 1.3 crore people are eligible to vote in the polls and of them more than 1.1 lakh are first-time voters.

The total number of voters in the civic polls stands at 1,32,10,206 which include 73,15,915 men, 58,93,418 women and 793 voters in the other category.This would be the first civic poll after the latest delimitation which has redrawn the civic wards. As per the new delimitation exercise, based on the 2011 Census, each ward now has an average of 60,000 people with an estimated 40,000 voters.Delhi has 70 Assembly seats and before the delimitation, every constituency had four wards, but, now it ranges from 3- 7.(Inputs from PTI)ALSO READ | MCD election: Yogendra Yadav calls Arvind Kejriwal betrayer of Delhi, seeks resignation after civic polls"

But, as the news spread activists of Bajrang Dal and VHP reached the Fatehpur Sikri police station, where they, according to local reports, had a heated exchange with the Circle Officer Ravikant Parashar.As tempers flew, VHP leader Jagmohan Chahar reportedly slapped the CO.

3663,300 WhatsApp groups used to mobilise stone-pelters in J&K,"encounter sites: Official Srinagar, Apr 23 (PTI) Nearly 300 Whatsapp groups were being used to mobilise stone-pelters in Kashmir to disrupt security forces operations at encounter sites, of which 90 per cent have been shut down, a police official said today. Each of these 300 Whatsapp groups had around 250 members, the official said while explaining how determined attempts were being made to disrupt the operations of the security forces by mobilising stone-pelting mobs at the encounter sites. ""We identified the groups and the group administrators, who were called in by police for counselling. We have had a good response to this initiative,"" he said on the condition of anonymity. In the last three weeks, more than 90 per cent of these Whatsapp groups have been shut down, the official said. He said the governments policy of suspending internet services appeared to be showing positive results in curbing stone-pelting during encounters and cited the case of yesterdays encounter in Budgam district. Just a few youth gathered to hurl stones after two militants were gunned down in the encounter yesterday. This was in sharp contrast to an encounter in Durbugh village in the same area on March 28, when a large number of stone-pelters had assembled and three of them were killed in firing by security forces. ""With no internet services, the mobilisation of mobs has almost become impossible. Earlier, we would see youth from as far as 10 kilometres from the encounter sites joining the protesters to pelt stones at security forces to disrupt the anti-militancy operations. ""That did not happen yesterday during or after the encounter in the absence of internet on mobiles,"" the official said. He said some of the youth listed personal issues like alleged harassment by security forces as reasons for taking to stone-pelting. ""Most of them get carried away momentarily,"" he said, adding authorities are also looking at further sensitising the personnel on the need to adopt a humane approach while dealing with the youth. ""With the internet facility withdrawn, the activity on these social networking groups and other sites like Facebook has come down drastically,"" he added. Stone-pelting on security forces near the encounter sites has been causing major operational problems for the law enforcing agencies over the past one year. More than half a dozen youth have been killed in such incidents in the first quarter of this year. However, the common people especially those from the business community say they are facing hardships, because of the inability to stay connected online. ""Today, the business depends on internet for communication. I am into stock markets and I have had no business since the mobile internet services were withdrawn on Monday,"" Mudasir Bhat said. Bhat said most of the people had done away with landlines and broadband internet services as mobile internet facility gave them more freedom and were also cheaper. Ishfaq Ahmad, a contractor by profession, said life, without internet, had come to a standstill. "
3664,Indian once performed 833 eye surgeries in 14 hours,"What Mother Teresa is to Calcutta's dying destitutes, Dr Murugappa Chennaveerappa Modi, 72. is to the poor blind villagers of Karnataka. For 45 years. Modi, the internationally recognised eye surgeon, has been waging a one-man war against blindness. In 1986, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records for performing 833 eye operations in a day, the highest in the world. The operations were conducted in Tirupati in 1968 over 14 continuous hours. Modi. Kannukota anna (the brother who gives vision) to the local people, has performed as many as 5.79 lakh eye operations so far. And his labour has always been free.For Modi, his mission is spiritual. ""I see myself as a poojary. The patient is my god, every village is my place of pilgrimage, the operating table is my shrine and my instruments are the accessories of worship,"" says the sprightly surgeon who lives a spartan existence. Born of humble parentage - a Kannadiga from Bijapur district - Modi threw away a lucrative career in private practice after attending Gandhiji's historic prayer meeting at Bombay on August 8, 1942 where the Quit India resolution was passed. That meeting changed his life. And Modi, the gifted ophthalmologist, dedicated his life to the sightless.""I felt affected when I saw blind people begging. They just did not have money to go to doctors."" Modi recalled.And those who had the money had often sold their jewellery or livestock to put it together for the treatment. This tragic fact of rural India spurred Modi to pioneer the concept of mass eye camps.In an assembly line fashion, Modi operates 40 patients an hour, attending to four patients at a time. Ambidextrous, he performs delicate eye surgeries with his left hand. He does cataract operations, squint corrections and cornea transplants. Earlier, Modi used to perform 600 to 700 operations a day in his camps. But now in Karnataka, he operates on 200 to 300 patients every day.His phenomenal contributions for the sightless have not gone unappreciated. Recognition has come to him through the Padma Shree and Padma Bhushan. Hellen Keller, the blind and deaf-mute American author, who attended one of his camps in 1954 asked Modi: ""Have you insured your hands?"" In his mass eye camps, apart from the 5.79 lakh operations, he has examined 50 lakh patients and given free food to over 100 lakh persons.Initially Modi had a hard time communicating his mission to the people. ""Villagers used to ask me if I was that good, why was I operating for tree? Modi reminisced. "
3665,Govt allows people to apply online for passports in Hindi,"By Ashwini Shrivastava New Delhi, Apr 23 (PTI) The Ministry of External Affairs has made a provision enabling people to apply online for passports in Hindi. The move comes after President Pranab Mukherjee recently accepted recommendations made in this regard by the Committee of Parliament on Official Language via its ninth report. The report was submitted in 2011. The panel had suggested that bilingual forms should be made available by all passport offices and forms filled in Hindi should also be accepted. It had recommended that entries should also be made in Hindi in all passports being issued. These recommendations have been accepted by the president recently, as per an official order. People can download the application form available in Hindi, fill it in and upload it while applying for the passport. The printout of filled-in form will not be accepted by Passport Seva Kendra and Regional Passport Offices. The panel on the official language had also recommended that information regarding passport and visa should be made available in Hindi on the official website of the ministry. ""This recommendation is accepted,"" the order said. "
3666,Video shows IAF officer being thrashed by mob; three held,"Delhi Police have arrested three people in respect to a video going viral on social media in which an Air Force Officer can be seen getting thrashed in full public view. The officer was allegedly assaulted and robbed by a group of men after his motorcycle brushed past their car in southeast Delhi's Sangam Vihar area, police said today. The officer was accosted and thrashed in the middle of the road, blocking the traffic. Sujay Kr Sikandar, a corporal posted at Tughlakabad told police that on April 20, his motorcycle had brushed past a Swift car. After that the vehicle overtook and stopped him on the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road near Batra Hospital. Two persons came out of the car and started beating him and his colleague, he told police. He added that in the meantime, another car also pulled up and its driver got into a argument over the road getting blocked. The three of them then dragged him and robbed his ID card as well as the registration certificate of his motorcycle, police said.One of the accused works as a milk supplier in Malviya Nagar. The others work as a storekeeper at a hotel in Mehrauli and as a bouncer at a club in Vasant Vihar. The robbed items have been recovered and the two cars have been seized. Several Twitter users posted the video, tagged the IAF's official account, and called for strict action. One man even tweeted the clip to the accounts run by the offices of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh.Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrashekhar on Friday tweeted the video to Delhi's Commissioner of Police Amulya Patnaik, and asked him to bring the culprits to book. He requested to ensure that the matter is investigated and the guys are booked. He even requested the general public to come forward and help with any details possible.The Air Force hasn't yet commented on the video, which has surfaced just days after CRPF jawans returning from a polling station in Srinagar's Budgam were assaulted by civilians. That attack, which failed to provoke the jawans, sparked outrage across the nation.PTI Inputs"
3667,I am open to doing a Bollywood film: Baahubali actor Prabhas,"With the release of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion a week away, Prabhas, 37, talks about the making of the Baahubali phenomenon, what his superhero status means to him and life after Baahubali exclusively to India Today.What was it like to play two different characters - Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali - both iconic and superheroes but with distinctly different personalities?When you look at the characters of Amarendra Baahubali and his son Mahendra Baahubali or Shiva, the biggest differentiator was their backgrounds. Amarendra grew up as a prince and Mahendra Baahubali grew up amidst a tribe as Shiva.He is destined for greatness, he's as strong as his father and as able a fighter too but doesn't know where he needs to go or what he needs to do. He doesn't know that his mother and his kingdom are waiting for him. He is actually pursuing a girl who he is mesmerised with but stumbles upon a greater purpose in the process. He is a passionate and rugged sort of a guy who can be rather blunt sometimes but that's just how he is designed. He's not rude or crude, just a bit different.Amarendra, on the other hand, was meant to be the king of the biggest kingdom ever - Mahishmati. He is more self-aware and has also grown up knowing his life purpose all along. Ultimately, they are both for the people. Keeping these distinctions clear and imbibing their individuality helped me understand these characters better.Was it a risk to dedicate four and a half years to this project?It is an extraordinary script and as a principal actor I had to do justice to it. I knew that an epic film of this proportion would take this much time to be made. More than physical strength or action-training, a certain mental strength was needed to give unfocused time to a great director (S S Rajamouli). Luckily, I know him for 12 years and know his passion for his work. It wasn't easy, but it had to be done. Every three or four months, Rajamouli used to show us the completed visuals or share an improvisation in the script. It was intriguing and insightful and kept us enthused all through.Would you say that your performance is better in part two?Yes. Part one focused more on introducing the characters, while part two is the resolution and offered greater scope for performance as well.Do you relate to the characters you played in Baahubali?I don't personally relate to any character. It is a film after all. My character kills a lot of people in the film, that doesn't mean that I will get inspired by him and start killing people. It's all about how hard I can work to step into the character. From my point of view, it's only about how best I can play that character.What would you do to get into the Baahubali mindset before getting on to the sets?Once I'm told about the character, I can't stop thinking about it. Baahubali has strong arms and unbending courage; he is detached from luxury and is beyond political power. A balanced compassionate person, he doesn't react much or show too much emotion. All the intensity in him reflects in his eyes. That is what I would try to bring into my own eyes before getting on to the set. What was your biggest challenge with Baahubali?More than a challenge, it was an endeavour to make Rajamouli happy. He is the most mad and passionate man I know. I just went into this project with the attitude that I would do my best; even if part one didn't work, I would still do part two with the same dedication. What we believe in, we must do 100 per cent. It can't be a case of 50, 40, 30 or even 99 per cent. Any special moments you often recall from the shooting days?There are so many, I can't pick one. I was awestruck when I saw the waterfall for the first time. I feel quite nostalgic about that.You continued with your archery training even after the shoot was over?Yes, I enjoyed learning archery and whenever I can, I still practice. I'm fascinated by it.On the intriguing question of why did Katappa kill Baahubali?We never imagined that it would turn into a legendary question. Even Rajamouli didn't think that it would. People across the nation speculating on theories and the jokes doing the rounds on social media were most amusing. It was the love of the audience in their own way, I would say.Back in real life, do you sometimes approach a problem or situation asking yourself how Baahubali would have approached the same situation?I never thought of it, but if Baahubali were to approach a situation or problem, he would just smile it off. (Smiles)Who were your childhood superheroes?Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, the usual. I never thought that one day I will be a superhero, be part of a franchise and appear in comics. Not even in my wildest dreams I thought I would be part of a cult film and be remembered. I always dreamed big as an actor but the way things turned out, I never imagined it would be this big.There are perhaps children who look up to you today as a superhero just as you did while you were young.Well, I feel lucky for that. It wasn't just Baahubali, but Bhallaladeva, Sivagami, Kattappa, all have become iconic characters and will be remembered.What are your aspirations for the future?I don't know. I will try to do something better with my performance. It can't get better than Baahubali as a film; that was something magical and once in a lifetime. I'm open to Bollywood if I'm offered a project that I can resonate with.Most often you keep a low profile, and are seen as shy and reclusive. What do you have to say?I come from a large family of several cousins on both sides. When all of us get together, the noise and drama are nothing short of a marriage function. Perhaps I was always so content and comfortable with my extended family that I didn't quite go out and make too many friends. I didn't grow up into too much of an outgoing person. Some people from big families turn out like that, I guess."
3668,Fur coat worn by Titanic survivor sells for over ?1 crore,"London, Apr 23 (PTI) A fur coat worn by a first class stewardess when the Titanic sank in 1912 has been sold for 150,000 pounds at an auction in the UK, almost double its original valuation of 80,000 pounds. Mabel Bennett, who was 33 at the time, was in her nightdress when the ship began to sink after hitting an ice berg. More than 1,500 passengers and crew died when the ship sank in April 1912, on its maiden voyage. She put on the beaver lamb fur coat she owned to keep her warm as she boarded lifeboat, the Telegraph reported. Bennett died aged 96 in 1974 and was the longest living female member of the crew. She passed the coat to her great niece in the 1960s as she found it too heavy to wear. The fur coat and letter of provenance went under the hammer yesterday at an auction at Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire. ""This stunning coat is unique in that not only was it a personal possession of a Titanic crew member that was worn... but, to our knowledge, represents the only piece of exceptionally well provenance clothing from Titanic to ever come to auction,"" the auctioneers said.

3676,Stalin slams govt for imposing Hindi on non-Hindi speakers,"DMK working president and treasurer, MK Stalin today slammed the central government for imposing Hindi on non-Hindi residents of the country. In a two-minute video, the leader asked the government to give up its efforts to sideline non-Hindi speaking people.Stalin said that right from the day of assuming power, the BJP-led central government has been making efforts to destroy and decimate the unity of the nation. He even slammed the recent parliamentary committee proposal to make it mandatory for MPS and Central ministers who know Hindi to use it as their official language, both in speeches and writings.Stalin also criticised the BJP government for obtaining permission from the President to use Hindi in airport announcements, press news and advertisements and also making it a compulsory subject in CBSE schools across the country.The DMK leader expressed his displeasure over central government schemes named only in Hindi or Sanskrit.He said that by enforcing Hindi on citizens from primary school students to Parliament, the BJP government is betraying all non-Hindi speaking people of the nation.  He also condemned the reforms by saying that they were against the spirit of the constitution of India that was framed under the leadership of Dr BR Ambedkar.Stalin further mentioned the schedule 8 of the Constitution of India according to which all languages including Tamil should be announced as official languages. He further said that despite the constitutional rights, the central government's actions are diametrically opposite to the people's sentiments.""I urge PM Modi government to give up these efforts of sidelining non-Hindi speaking citizens,"" said Stalin.He added that Dravidian movement has a longstanding history of spearheading the anti-Hindi movement.

3677,Even Allah doesn't want impure mosque in Ayodhya: RSS,"Senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Indresh Kumar on Saturday said that Muslims in India have understood that even Allah doesn't want an 'impure' mosque at the disputed site in Ayodhya.Speaking to India Today, the veteran RSS functionary and convener of its minority cell - Muslim Rashtriya Manch said, ""Muslims have realised that since Allah himself has not allowed the mosque to come up there, it's unlikely that it will ever come up.""Questioning the legitimacy of the Babri Masjid, Kumar said that the 15th century structure was named after an individual (Babur) and so it could never be used by Muslims as they only worshiped one God.""The land is disputed and it was claimed after destroying a Ram temple that existed there, thus Allah never accepted the structure and even namaz was never conducted at the place. Today, Muslims have realized that it was an illegal structure,"" he explained.Going back in time, the veteran RSS ideologue blamed the dispute on a mistake by Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the subcontinent. TRY BABUR IN COURT ""The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was destroyed by Babur 400 years ago. Had he not indulged in that act to build such an impure mosque, there would not have been such a predicament today. I would like to appeal to the courts of the land that if someone needs to be tried it should be Babur and his army general Mir Baqi,"" he added.At a time when the RSS backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch is backing the call for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Kumar said that many in the community have stated that they don't want an 'illegal' mosque, especially one that was built on a disputed land.""They (Muslims) have realised that Ram and Khuda are all the same, they are one supreme power. The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram,"" he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate.""They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever. They have understood that even though they may be Muslims by faith but in Hindustan their ancestors were all Hindus and their social and domestic customs too were that of the Hindus,"" Kumar said.Also read:Babri Masjid demolition: Supreme Court restores conspiracy charges against LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti"

Mufti Islah, a journalist based out of Srinagar, tweeted that four people, including the girl, were injured and that five 'gau rakshaks' were behind the attack.NDTV and Islah both said that those attacked belong to the same nomad family and that the attackers took away the family's entire flock of goats, sheep and cows. ""We have registered an FIR. I have asked DIG of Udhampur range to visit the area. Strict action will be taken against these goons,"" Jammu and Kashmir police chief SP Vaid was quoted as saying by NDTV.Recounting the incident, one of the victims of the attack told NDTV, ""They beat us ruthlessly. Somehow we managed to flee from there. One of our children, a 10-year-old, is still missing. We don't know whether he is alive or dead. They even beat our elders very badly. They wanted to kill us and throw our bodies into the river."" The Jammu and Kashmir incident comes against the backdrop of heightened cow vigilantism in the country. Just this month, the Alwar attack, in which one diary farm owner was killed by cow vigilantes, sparked nationwide furore. Leading government officials and political figures, including RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, have come out strongly against such attacks, with police officials in the country also vowing to take strong action against such attackers."

3693,"Muslims don't vote for us, but we gave them sanctity: Prasad","New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today said Muslims do not vote for the BJP, but the government has given them ""proper sanctity"". ""We have got 13 chief ministers of our own. We are ruling the country. Have we victimised any Muslim gentleman working in the industry or service? Have we dismissed them? We dont get Muslim votes. I acknowledge very clearly, but have we given them proper sanctity or not?"" Prasad asked at the Mindmine Summit here. He was responding to a question related to development having an impact on culture and diversity. ""We salute diversity and culture of India. There are two ways of looking at it. Let me be very frank today. There has been campaign against us for a very long time, but today we are here because of blessings of people of India,"" Prasad said. In recent Assembly elections, the BJP scored an impressive win in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The party also formed government in Goa and Manipur. Its main rival Congress was able to get a clear majority in Punjab only. As IT minister, Prasad said, he has visited many Muslim-dominated villages where many Muslim youth are running Common Service Centres which help people avail of government services through Internet. The minister cited the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi short-listing a Muslim tea garden labourer in Jalpaiguri, Karimul Haque, for his exemplary work. Prasad said Haque has converted his motorcycle into an ambulance, rushes whosoever falls sick to hospital and in the process, has saved nearly 2,000 lives. ""We never saw religion of Haque or whether he voted for us or not. If there are certain uncalled for voices, the Prime Minister addresses the concerns, the CMs (chief ministers) address concerns. Yogi (Adityanath) is a popular leader. You are seeing his instances of good governance and inclusive development,"" Prasad said. The minister said he has issues with those in the Left and journalists spreading ""hatred"" against Modi. ""We have a problem with some of our friends. Mostly, the Leftist friends and journalists who entertain a pathological hatred against Narendra Modi. Good luck to them,"" Prasad quipped. According to Prasad, the Left is ""left out"" all over the world and had been defeated in India. ""They are left out in Bengal, are surviving in Kerala and Tripura, but the Left has got a very good campus in Delhi, which is the JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) and I always say the Left also needs some consolation prize.

She said that if Congress manages to win a ""good number"" of seats in the municipal corporation elections, then Maken will prove his detractors in Delhi Congress wrong.

3695,Punjab govt cuts down VIP security including CM's,"New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Punjab today cut down on VIP security, including that of the chief minister, by a whopping 2,000 personnel and decided to deploy them to ensure better policing and improve the law-and-order situation in the state. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also directed the police to review the arms and ammunition licences to check unbridled proliferation of arms in the hands of criminals. The decision was taken at a high-level security review meeting chaired by Amarinder and attended by Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Suresh Arora and Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) Dinkar Gupta, besides Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar. The withdrawal of security also includes pruning of the chief ministers security from 1,392 to 1,016 personnel. Some 1,500-odd security personnel have been withdrawn in other categories of constitutional and government functionaries, an official spokesperson said after the meeting. The chief minister has already ordered withdrawal of all deployment along his travel routes and his security is likely to be cut down further at the next review meeting, based on fresh reports on threat perceptions. Amarinder has made it clear that he does not want security beyond the ""bare necessity"". He has also directed the police and other agencies to review the existing security policy, which was approved by the Punjab cabinet and subsequently notified by the Department of Home Affairs and Justice in 2013. The chief minister underlined the need to provide only ""need-based"" security, taking the latest threat perception for individuals into account. With the existing security policy being three-year-old, he directed the police to call for fresh reports from the state and central agencies to map the threat perceptions of individuals who have been provided security and then decide on the quantum of security. This was the second security review meeting of the Amarinder-led Congress government since it took over the reins of Punjab last month. At the first meeting in March of a committee headed by the DGP (Law-and-Order), as many as 749 police and paramilitary personnel were withdrawn from various categories of protectees. The Congress manifesto for the Punjab Assembly polls had clearly stated that the ""unhealthy"" trend of the use of policemen by politicians and bureaucrats for their personal security will be discouraged strongly. Amarinder expressed grave concern at the threat posed to internal security as a result of arms proliferation, which had led to several incidents of law-and-order violation in the state. He ordered a comprehensive review of all the arms licences issued by district magistrates and police commissionerates. Amarinder also directed a propriety audit of the arms licences issued after the notification of the Arms Rules, 2016, which came into effect from July 15, 2016. "

3706,Modiji will not run MCD: Arvind Kejriwal,"Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has promised a hands-on role in running Delhi?s municipal corporations if AAP comes to power in Sunday?s elections but ruled out any involvement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the city?s administration if the BJP retains power.?The BJP is seeking votes only, and only, in the name of Modiji. I would like to tell people that Modiji is not going to run MCD? MCD will only be run by Kejriwal,? the AAP national convener told Hindustan Times in an interview on Thursday.The AAP is making its debut in Delhi civic elections, being billed as a barometer for the Kejriwal government?s popularity two years after it won an overwhelming mandate in the assembly polls.Kejriwal argued that Delhi?s elected government has been reduced to an ?advisory? role because all files went to the Lieutenant-Governor?s office for clearance, but things would be different in the MCDs. ?Under MCD rules... the House is supreme,? he said.The Delhi CM said his government has demolished several ?mafias? which were allegedly active in the state government ?power, water, medicines, contractors, education ? and would end the parking, hoarding and contractors? mafia in the MCD.In the interview to Hindustan Times, the AAP national convener said the April 23 elections were a direct fight between AAP and the BJP. Kejriwal spoke about solutions for the city?s civic mess, corruption and a series of other issues in a free-wheeling conversation. Here are the excerpts of the interview:Why should Delhi vote for AAP in Sunday?s MCD elections?Compare 10 years of the BJP in MCD and AAP?s two years in government in Delhi. I regularly ask the people of Delhi if they can remember one work of the BJP-ruled MCDs. No one remembers even one. What comes to mind when I say ?BJP in MCD? -- they converted Delhi into a dumpyard; dengue and chikungunya; rampant corruption.When you remember two years of AAP in government, everybody names at least these: power rates halved, free water, potable water in taps in some areas, improved conditions in hospitals, medicines and tests in hospitals for free, mohalla clinics, revolutionary work in education, private schools not allowed to hike fees.Now, we need to come together and clean Delhi. Delhi is the national capital, but there is so much of filth. There are mosquitoes all around, which lead to the spread of dengue and chikungunya. People of Delhi have this hope of cleaning Delhi only from AAP. That?s why they should vote for us.In that case, will the result be a referendum on your government?s performance?Whatever I say, media will interpret it that way. The BJP is seeking votes in the name of Modiji. But people of Delhi area aware that Modiji is not going to run the MCDs. Two years back, Modiji gave the slogan of Swachh Bharat, which was a very nice campaign. But the Delhi BJP failed even the Swachh Bharat campaign. Only AAP can make Delhi Swachh.Is Modi a factor in the MCD elections?I don?t think he is. The BJP is seeking votes only, and only, in the name of Modiji. I would like to tell people that Modiji is not going to run the MCD? MCD will only be run by Kejriwal.One of your campaign pitches is that if AAP comes to power in MCD, governance in Delhi will become smooth because you are also in government. How are the two linked?Let me give you some examples. In our budget last year, we allocated around Rs 250 crore for safety of women. We identified 40,000 dark spots across the city. We decided to make those areas well-lit. The BJP got a resolution passed in the MCD house that we will not allow installation of streetlight on MCD roads if they are funded by the AAP government. Who lost due to such petty politics? The women of Delhi.Similarly, we allocated Rs 1,500 crore over the past two years to provide drinking water in all colonies which are not on the piped water network. We had set target of December, 2017. We have been able to bring 309 colonies on the water network in one year. But the MCD passed a resolution that the Delhi government will not be allowed to lay pipelines on corporation roads. Who is losing? The people of Delhi.You have alleged that the Centre creates obstacles in the functioning of the Delhi government. Won?t things be the same if you come to power in MCDs?Things are different in the MCD. Under the rules, the L-G has no role in the MCD. Though there are few sections where the Home Ministry has powers, the MCD is much more independent than the Delhi government. In MCD, the house is supreme.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal during an interview with HT  on Thursday. ?Violence has increased in the country. Volence in thought, violence in speech, violence in action. The State is accountable for curbing violence. It is not not doing it,? he said.
							(Saumya Khandelwal/ Hindustan Times)
						Manish Sisodia told us in February that after the appointment of Anil Baijal, there was a thaw in your government?s relationship with the L-G office. Things seem to be changingTill the end of March, we had very pleasant interactions with the new L-G. He cleared several projects. Now all files go to the L-G ? he is supreme, the elected government has almost become advisory. But since the announcement of elections, the Shunglu Committee report was leaked, our office was taken away, recovery of advertisements worth Rs 97 crore was ordered. There was no provocation from our side. In fact, we had been praising him. But over the past fortnight, he has been firing one salvo after other. It?s for everyone to see.So, who is better L-G from your perspective -- Anil Baijal or Najeeb Jung? I don?t think we should comment on individuals. We had a very cordial relationship (with Baijal). I used to meet him at 5 pm every Wednesday. Dialogues had increased, meetings were revived. But the development over the past 15-20 days raise doubts if his political masters are directing him to do all this.What is this election really about: keeping Delhi clean or building a larger political narrative?It?s the MCD election, and MCD elections should be contested on local issues. There is no point of voting for Congress, the party is finished. If you vote for the BJP, remember that the garbage outside your house will continue to remain unattended for the next five years, mosquito menace will remain. Any vote for BJP is a vote for filth and chikungunya.In the periphery of Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon, we have seen meat shops being shut, anti-Romeo squads. Do you think these issues impact the MCD elections?The entire country needs to think about all this. Firstly, violence has increased in the country. Violence in thought, violence in speech, violence in action. The State is accountable for curbing violence. The State should immediately take action against the culprits. That is not happening. If people resorting to violence belong to a particular party, no action is taken. The message is that people associated with that party can do anything, but no action will be taken.The second discourse is that the entire country is being frightened. The income-tax law has been made draconian. It is almost a financial version of TADA. They can raid anybody?s house and office. Businessmen and traders are under fear. Media and journalists are afraid. An atmosphere of fear has been created. This is neither good for the country, or the people.You were recently quoted as saying that if AAP wins less than 200 seats, EVMs would be to blame.No. I said that if the elections are held, free and fair and EVMs are not tampered with, AAP has hopes of winning over 200 seats. We expect such a result as per our survey.The allegation is that by talking about EVMs, you are preparing a ground that if AAP loses the election then the blame could be pinned on voting machines.The media is putting it out in a simplistic manner. If EVMs are tampered, then it is not affecting the health of Kejriwal, it is affecting the health of the nation. If EVMs are not tamper-proof, no one can save the country. I am more worried about that. You would ask, why didn?t you speak when you won 67 seats. If we won 67 seats, BJP also won in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand -- we didn?t raise questions then. Something has happened over the past four months. Suddenly several instances, evidences have started emerging about EVM manipulation. Unfortunately, the response of election commission has been that all is fine. They are not investigating it. If an independent candidate in Pune says that he got zero vote -- he should get his own vote, at least -- it?s a serious thing. Where did his vote go? At least probe it. In Bhind, all votes went to the BJP in the presence of 20 journalists. Within two days, the election commission issued statement saying, there was nothing wrong. It does not inspire confidence. There was something wrong with the machine. Now they are saying the journalists made a mistake. Twenty journalists made a mistake when even videos are available.What if you win the MCD elections? Will the fight against EVMs continue? Yes, we will continue the fight against EVMs.The Punjab results didn?t go as you would?ve liked. Is that making things difficult on the ground?No, it?s not like that. But a positive result in Punjab would definitely have had an impact.In the Rajouri Garden bypoll, the vote share increase of the BJP was sizeable. It is different from the past when its vote share used to remain constant? Is it worrisome for you? In Rajouri, the election was completely local. It would be wrong to extrapolate it to across Delhi. When I resigned after 49 days, people got very angry. It took me five-six months to convince them. I apologized to people. People then understood and gave us 67 seats. The same anger was palpable in Rajouri, that he (AAP legislator Jarnail Singh) left midway. But we didn?t get time to convince them. People have vented out their anger. It doesn?t have a larger impact.Secondly, the BJP has got fewer votes than the previous occasion. Last time, it got about 45,000 votes. This time it has come down to 41,000. The total voting percentage was 20 per cent less. So their (BJP) numbers remained the same, but it?s looking high in percentage terms.Why are you asking people not to vote for Congress? Are you suggesting that the BJP will have an edge in a triangular contest? No, that?s not the case. I think the contest is mainly between the BJP and AAP.Now all files go to the L-G ? he is supreme, the elected government has almost become advisory? The MCD is much more independent. In MCD, the house is supreme, Kejriwal said.

						You have announced waiver of house tax. The urban experts are say this is not the way to go about it. Instead of improving inefficiency in collection, why do you want to finish it?There is no lack of funds, just a a lack of intent. We made power and water cheaper while lowering taxes. If do not require tax, why should I burden the people? House tax collection is meagre, but harassment is big. The inspector deliberately makes inflated bills. People are forced to pay bribe to get their bills amended. Let?s end it. Our calculation is that you can actually run MCD profitably without charging house tax.Water consumption went down as it was incentivised. As far as house tax goes, shouldn?t citizens be paying some taxes? But they are paying other taxes. If there is no need, why should we tax people? If we can show that MCD could operate without charging house tax, it would become a model for the entire world. Why should we charge house tax which is regressive? It leads to corruption. With one stroke, we can end harassment and make people?s lives easier, without much impact on revenue. It?s a win-win for everyone.So, what are the biggest problems with how the MCD runs Delhi, and what are the solutions?The biggest issue is sanitation. Cleaning the city is not rocket science. Global tenders need to be floated. Sanitation levels in several European countries are very good. Bring those companies here, they will clean Delhi.Second is solid waste management. Landfills have been converted into mountains. MCD spends crores on the lifting and disposing of garbage. Actually, you can make money out of it. Several European nations buy garbage of other countries. Garbage has economic value. It can be turned around totally. You can use garbage for generation of energy and compost.The third major issue is vector-borne diseases. The only reason is lack of sanitation. Our MLA from Moti Nagar, Shiv Charan Goyal, has made some local intervention, which has led to eradication of mosquitoes in the area. We?re not building castles in air when we say we will make the city free of mosquito, dengue and chikungunya. We have set a target of three years to do this.The fourth thing is MCDs have become financially bankrupt. We can make the MCDs self-sustainable. The sources of revenue generation of the MCDs are much more than the Delhi government, and the law allows us to explore many more. We can convert MCD into a modern, vibrant and financially self-sufficient organisation.A lot of this comes down to corruption How will you tackle it?More than corruption, there are mafias. Over the past two years, we have demolished five types of mafia. The first was the tanker mafia. In Kirari, the water business ran into crores. Several tankers used to feed the area, now not one is required. Water pipelines were laid in 80 colonies.The second was the drug mafia. A mafia of 6-7 drug suppliers was controlling everything in government hospitals. They used to raise fake bills and share the spoils with others. No medicine supply was done in Delhi. Now, medicines are available in all hospitals. Earlier, patients were directed to buy medicines from outside. Now even a Rs 2,000 tablet is available in Delhi government hospitals for free.Third was the power discoms. Till the time Shiela Dikshit was in power, power tariffs were revised every year. We have not allowed tariff revision over the past two years. Many people accuse us of not providing any subsidy to households consuming over 400 units energy per month. It?s them who have benefitted from this cap on tariff revision.Then comes the mafia of contractors. Over-billing was the norm in all contracts of the PWD. I often cite the example of construction of flyovers -- we completed work in Rs 200 crore instead of the estimated Rs 325 crore. Other governments would have raised the bills to Rs 1,000 crore.The last was the education mafia. Schools are owned by politicians. We didn?t allow them to raise schools fees in last two years.We have demolished five types of mafia. In MCDs, there are mafias as well -- parking, hoardings and contractors. Only we can demolish them, nobody else."
3707,GST reform is really an act of courage: IMF Chief Lagarde,"From Lalit K Jha Washington, Apr 20 (PTI) Describing the ongoing Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform as an ""act of courage"", IMF chief Christine Lagarde today said she expects ""some positive outcome"" as a result of the decision. ""The GST reform is really an act of courage,"" Lagarde told reporters during the annual Spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It really means reforming in-depth in each of the Indian States in order to substitute the State taxes with overall federal tax, the re-allocation of it and the digital platform that supports it, she said. ""So, I am personally impressed by the work that is being done in that regard and expect some positive outcome,"" Lagarde said in response to a question, adding that she is impressed by the other reforms being carried out by the Indian Government. ""There has been other reforms as well that has been conducted by the Indian authorities courageously. One of them -? as a former lawyer I am particularly attentive to because it particularly when you have to deal with the corporate sector banking sector that means help -- is the bankruptcy reform,"" the 61-year-old IMF chief said. ""We are seeing significant development and clear determination to continue and sustain growth going forward,"" she said. Lagarde said the situation in the country after demonetisation has ""improved significantly"". ""We have slightly revised down our Indian projection as a result of demonetisation that has been announced recently a little bit unexpectedly. Our understanding is that demonetisation has now remedied about 75 per cent. Those are the latest figures that we have,"" she said. "
3708,"How can you make Aadhaar mandatory, SC asks Centre","The Supreme Court today came down hard on the government over the issue of making Aadhaar compulsory in complete violation of the apex court's previous order.""How can you make Aadhaar mandatory despite a clear order to make it optional. Is making Aadhaar by force the only way to tackle fraud?"" a furious Supreme Court told the Centre while hearing a PIL against the government's decision making Aadhaar compulsory. The Supreme Court bench led by Justice Sikri questioned the Centre as to how Aadhar can be made compulsory and forced on people. The Centre's argument has been that the earlier order merely applies for beneficiary schemes like LPG and food grains and the government is free to use it for other services like income tax.GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSEThe contention here is of reading the earlier order. While the Centre is making case for a narrow reading of the order restricting it to essential services and beneficiary schemes, the petitioners have given the earlier order a broad reading. The main matter in Aadhaar is pending on the question of the right to privacy.  ""We found a number of of Pan cards being used to divert funds to shell companies. To prevent this, the only option is to make Aadhaar card mandatory,"" Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court bench.WHAT SUPREME COURT RULING SAYSThe Supreme Court had on March 27 made it clear that Aadhaar cards cannot be made mandatory by the government for extending benefits of social welfare schemes.The top court, however, said that the government cannot be barred from seeking these cards, which are issued by UIDAI, for ""non-benefit"" purposes like filing of IT returns and opening of accounts""The answer is this that for giving benefits of welfare schemes, it (Aadhaar) cannot be pressed. They (government and its agencies) cannot be stopped from seeking Aadhaar for non-benefit schemes like opening of bank accounts,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar had said. The apex court on August 11, 2015 had said that Aadhaar cards will not be mandatory for availing benefits of government's welfare schemes and barred the authorities from sharing personal biometric data collected for enrollment under the schemeHowever, on October 15, 2015 it had lifted its earlier restriction and permitted the voluntary use of Aadhaar cards in welfare schemes that also included MGNREGA, all pension schemes and the provident fund besides ambitious flagship programmes like 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna' of the NDA government.(With PTI inputs) ALSO READ:Aadhaar card can't be made mandatory by government for welfare schemes: Supreme Court"
3709,Raveena Tandon's 'Maatr' hits the theatres,"Director: Ashtar Sayed Cast: Raveena Tandon, Madhur Mittal, Divya Jagdale, Anurag Arora, Rushad RanaRating:  (1.5/5) Not Without My Daughter, Taken, The Brave One are just some of the Hollywood thrillers that come to mind when sitting through Maatr, a revenge drama, in which a traumatised mother takes the law into her own hands and tracks down the killers. But writer Michael Pellico throws in Indian references to in the Mahabharata and the brutal gangrape which is reminiscent of the Nirbhaya case. For all its grittiness, Maatr is barely able to skim the surface of a woman's paranoia unlike Pink, another drama about sexual assault which is set in the capital.Raveena Tandon plays Vidya, a teacher, who witnesses her bright daughter's brutal rape and subsequent demise. She is a bruised, battered victim herself but the makers pretty much sideline Vidya's trauma to focus on her grief. Here too one of the perpetrators is a man with influence, in this case it's the bratty son (Madhur Mittal of Slumdog Millionaire) of the Chief Minister. This is one of the earlier signs that in Maatr playing out extremities is more important than allowing moments of reflection and empathy. When justice is out of her reach (""it's not like filter coffee that you get it instantly""), Vidya with a little help of Facebook, Google Maps, email, drugs and a gun plots the death of the seven accused. While some are well-executed, most are a bit sudden and haphazard. The latter makes the film occasionally germane and at times improbable. Tandon does well as the more amateurish Liam Neeson but one wishes for more context to her character instead of just a well-coiffed, vengeful, death magnet of a mother. Little time is devoted to her doomed marriage with an inconsiderate husband who blames her poor navigation skills for the tragedy. As the sole witness of the murder and survivor she is also surprisingly given too much free reign to execute her plan. Another minor sexual assault victim is included to heighten the anger, but in Maatr this seems more a lazy plot convenience. As the clock approaches the hour mark, Sayed raises the violence quotient adding kicks and punches to the action but the blows don't quite have the emotional impact. Maatr despite the gravity of the theme is a subpar drama. The film would have been more effective if the mawkish, flashback-heavy songs were skipped. Maatr is a missed opportunity to make a powerful statement against India's poor track record in dispensing justice and tackling violence against women. Revenge is a dish best served cold; in Maatr it's crass and oddly flat too. "

3711,Railways asked to pay ?30K to family which couldn't use loo,"The inability of Indian Railways' to stop unauthorised crowd occupying reserved seats of a train has cost it a sum of Rs 30,000 as a compensation to a family which could not use washrooms for more than an hour an half as the passage to the toilet was blocked. Dev Kant, who is the deputy legal advisor in the ministry of law and justice took the Indian Railways to the consumer court saying they had encountered mental and physical stress due to deficiency in service while travelling from Amrtisar to Delhi in 2009 with his wife and two children. WHAT HAPPENEDAfter seven years of protracted legal battle, the state consumer forum upheld the compensation of Rs 30,000 awarded to his family that was awarded by the district consumer court. The complainant told the court that a big crowd entered into the reserved compartments at Ludhiana Railway station by force and occupied all the vacant seats. Those who could not find a place to sit squatted on compartment's floor and blocked the passages towards the washrooms and the washbasin, the complainant said. Speaking to Mail Today, Dev Kant's son Harisharan Bagga, who is also an advocate, said the crowd did not let him use the washroom for around 90 minutes. ""The passage was jam packed and the crowd was uncooperative. Also, apart from my father my sister and my mother were also traveling with us and it was an uncomfortable situation for them as well,"" said Bagga. ""We brought it to the notice of the TTE and asked him to call the railway police but he did not bother and went away after expressing his inability to handle the situation,"" Bagga added. The counsel for the Northern Railways told court that the crowd was asked to vacate the train at the Ambala station and, therefore, had taken timely action. "
3712,BJP MP backs claim of Modi's conspiracy against Advani,"Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad today found an unusual support from BJP leader Vinay Katiyar over his remark that Supreme Court's revival of the conspiracy charge against BJP veteran LK Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case was a conspiracy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the party veteran from the Presidential race. ""May be his (Lalu's) statement has truth in it. I don't know,"" Katiyar, who is a member of Rajya Sabha, said. Katiyar's statement is certain to raise a few eyebrows in the BJP leadership, which has reportedly assured Advani that the party is with him after the Supreme Court ruling that he along with Murli Manohar Joshi and Union Minister Uma Bharti will have to face criminal conspiracy charge in Babri Masjid demolition case.Katiyar, the founder leader of Bajrang Dal, is one of the BJP leaders named in the Babri demolition case who would also face trial along with the party veterans. WHAT LALU HAD SAID: ""The CBI is in the hands of the Prime Minister, and the CBI said in court that the case of conspiracy should take place against Advani in the Babri case. Advani was tipped to become President this time,"" Lalu had said in Patna soon after the Supreme Court's ruling.""The PM has clipped Advani's chances of becoming the President. Anyone can understand that it is a political conspiracy of the Modi government to eliminate Advani from the race,"" he added.

3716,You think you can say whatever you want? NGT asks Sri Sri,"The National Green Tribunal, the highest environmental court in the country, today slammed Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for alleging bias in a tribunal committee's recent report on Yamuna riverbed damage. The report criticised Art of Living's World Culture Festival, held in March last year, for damaging the Yamuna riverbank and went to quantify the damage caused. The NGT today termed Ravi Shankar's statements alleging bias ""shocking"" and also slammed Art of Living. ""You have no sense of responsibility. Do you think you have the liberty to say whatever you want?"" the NGT bench asked, setting the next date of hearing to May 9.Responding to the statement of NGT, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has said that Art Of Living has done no wrong. ""The truth is we have caused no damage to the Yamuna.

""We have placed significant material on record before the NGT (National Green Tribunal) which clearly shows the committee is biased. Our application in this regard has not yet been heard,"" Sri Sri Ravi Shankar was quoted as saying in a statement by news agency IANS. ""From randomly pronouncing damages for Rs 120 crore, they have come down to Rs 13 crore; from permanent damage, they are now saying 10 years.

The move comes after Delhi governments Health Department approached the State Election Commissioner urging him to declare all the polling stations as tobacco free zones rather than just declaring them as smoke-free as it used to be in earlier elections. In a letter to Commissioner S K Srivastava, Additional Director (Health) Dr S K Arora noted that since chew-able tobacco, a leading cause of oral cancer, is already banned in Delhi, the polling booths should be declared tobacco free. The decision should be taken in larger public health interest, he stressed. The Commission has now sought cooperation of the Commissioners of all three civic bodies - South, North and East municipal corporation -- to create tobacco free poll booths for the MCD polls and display multi-colour banners at each location indicating the same. ""It is an excellent opportunity to sensitise nearly 1.33 crore adults on a single day as they will come to cast their vote at the polling booths,"" Dr Arora said. He said 90 per cent of oral cancers, 40 per cent of all cancers and 30 per cent of tuberculosis cases occur because of tobacco habits. Also, 20 per cent cases of diabetes, hypertension, heart attack and brain stroke are also linked to tobacco consumption, he added. The Health department will also provide signages/banners to be displayed at the entry gate of each polling booth. The banners will have content to educate people about the ill effects of tobacco consumption including smoking. "

3723,"CBSE warns schools against selling books, uniforms","The Central Board of Secondary Education has told schools affiliated to it that educational institutions are not commercial establishments and sale of books, uniforms and stationery by them is a violation of norms. An advisory has been issued following complaints from parents and stakeholders that schools are indulging in commercial activities by way of selling books and uniforms within the school premises or through selected vendors.

The morale of the staff will also be affected,? Air India said in a letter.AI also asked the Delhi Police commissioner to take the two complaints made by the airline to a logical conclusion.Gaikwad was taken off a no-fly list by Air India and five other airlines earlier this month following an intervention from the civil aviation ministry, which had said legal proceedings against the Osmanabad MP would continue. The FIR was filed on March 23. There was no comment from police or the airline.Gaikwad sparked nationwide outrage last month after a video apparently showing him hitting a 60-year-old AI staffer went viral on social media.

3727,India changes its four-decade-old definition of blindness,"India has changed its over four-decade-old definition of blindness, bringing it in line with the WHO criteria, a step that would drastically bring down the number of people considered ""blind"" in the country.According to the new definition, a person who is unable to count fingers from a distance of three metres would be considered ""blind"" as against the earlier stipulation of six metres, which was adopted in 1976.The aim of revising the definition is also to be able to generate data which can be compared with global estimates and achieve the WHO goal of reducing the blindness prevalence of India to 0.3 per cent of the total population by 2020. The notification in this regard has been issued by the Union Health Ministry.Going by the new definition, the population of blind people in India will reduce from 1.20 crore (as per National Blindness survey 2007 data) to 80 lakh.""Because of the earlier definition, we were projecting a higher figure of blind people from India at any international forum, presenting ourselves in poor light.""Also, the data that we generated under the programme could not be compared with the global estimates as other countries were following the WHO definition,"" said Dr Promila Gupta, Deputy Director General of National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB).Further, India has to achieve the goal set by the WHO which recommends reducing the prevalence of blindness to 0.3 per cent by 2020 to achieve the elimination of avoidable blindness.""It would have been extremely difficult to achieve the WHO goal using the earlier NPCB definition since we had been addressing an extra 4 million (40 lakh) individuals blind due to refractive errors. Whereas, by adopting the blindness criteria of WHO, India now can achieve the goal,"" said Professor Praveen Vashist, in-charge Community Ophthalmology at Dr R P Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Also, the name of the scheme, 'National Programme for Control of Blindness' has been changed to 'The National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment'.""The programme, henceforth, will not only focus on the blind persons but also those with some kind of visual impairment. With the change in nomenclature, the number of beneficiaries will now increase to 40 million,"" Dr Vashist added.The previous definition of blindness was adopted at the time of the inception of the NPCB in 1976.""The probable reason for keeping 6 metres as the cut off distance for defining blindness in India was to include economic blindness cases which referred to a level of blindness which prevents an individual to earn his or her wages.""In contrast, the WHO definition adopts a criteria for blindness that is which hampers the routine social interaction of a person (social blindness),"" Gupta said."

3729,Serena Williams suggests she is pregnant on Snapchat,"Serena Williams is pregnant with her first child, her spokesperson has confirmed.The tennis star hinted at the good news when she posted a photo of herself on Snapchat wearing a swimsuit and revealing what appeared to be a large baby bump with the caption ?20 weeks? on Wednesday. The snap was deleted less than a half hour later.However, Williams? team confirmed the implications of the photo later in the day. ?I?m happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this fall,? a spokesperson for Williams told the Guardian by email.The Women?s Tennis Association, which listed Williams as scheduled to enter next month?s Madrid Open as recently as Monday, said they had yet to be contacted by anyone from the American?s team regarding her status.?We have not been informed, nor do we have confirmation,? a tour spokesperson told the Guardian. ?We will let you know once we have further information.?Serena's snap suggests that she won the Australian Open without dropping a set while pregnant. pic.twitter.com/ltPndJRJBqWilliams, 35, announced she was engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in December. The announcement left the sport?s chattering class wondering to what degree she was looking ahead to life after tennis.She answered that speculation with brio at the Australian Open, capturing her 23rd major singles title without dropping a set, to eclipse Steffi Graf?s record for grand slam titles in the Open era and regain the No1 ranking she had ceded in the fall to Germany?s Angelique Kerber.But she has been inactive since her win over elder sister Venus in the final at Melbourne Park. Last month, Williams pulled out of Indian Wells and Miami, citing a left knee injury. That enabled Kerber to retake the top ranking, though Serena is assured a return to No1 in next week?s table when the points from last year?s Porsche Grand Prix drop off.The announcement comes one week after Victoria Azarenka, the former world No1 and two-time grand slam champion, announced she will return to the tour after 14-month layoff that included the birth of her son, Leo, in December.Williams? win at Melbourne Park made her the oldest player to win a major singles championship in the Open era, breaking a record she set herself last year ? and again the year before that. She has won grand slam titles in her teens (one), 20s (12) and 30s (10, more than triple the previous mark). No one could think less of Williams, now closer to 40 than 30, if she called it a career.But there?s equal if not more reason to believe Williams has unfinished business.She remains tantalizingly close to the all-time grand slam record held by Australia?s Margaret Court, whose 24 major titles were split between the amateur and professional eras. She still plays at an extraordinary high level, having won 125 of her 138 singles matches since Wimbledon 2014. And while there are no shortage of young lions on the tour, among them Garbi e Muguruza, Karol na Pl ?kov  and Madison Keys, none has offered a sustained challenge of Williams? dominance the way Monica Seles swiftly ended Graf?s stranglehold on the sport.Nor would Williams be the first mother to excel on the tour.Kim Clijsters was already a borderline Hall of Famer when she retired abruptly at 23, having won the 2005 US Open and spent 19 weeks atop the women?s rankings. But the Belgian was even better after a 28-month layoff that included the birth of her daughter, winning once more at Flushing Meadows as an unseeded wild card in only her third tournament back. That made her the first mother to win a major singles title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley at Wimbledon in 1980, setting the stage for a final act that included two more grand slam titles and a return to the No1 ranking."

3731,Delhi HC refuses AAP's request for use of paper trail EVMs,"The Delhi high court on Tuesday declined Aam Aadmi Party?s request to use second-generation EVMs with paper trail in the April 23 civic polls in the national capital.Justice AK Pathak refused immediate relief to the ruling party, saying that ?nothing can be done at the eleventh hour?. ?We cannot stay the election nor pass an order to use electronic voting machines which are not there,? the court said while seeking a response from the Election Commission of India and the Delhi State Election Commission by Friday, the next date of hearing.The AAP and its candidate Mohammad Tahir Hussain have approached the high court for using second-generation EVMs attached with Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the elections to the capital?s three municipal corporations.The court?s order came after State Election Commission counsel Sumeet Pushkarna opposed the plea on the ground that the MCD elections are slated for April 23 and changing all EVMs with VVPAT is not feasible in four days.The counsel said the EVMs to be used in the civic polls are the same that were used in 2015 assembly elections, after which the AAP came to power. ?But now they have speculation that these machines are tampered with. There are three judgements that elections at this stage cannot be stalled,? he added.Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the AAP and Hussain, contended that the poll panel was duty-bound to use the VVPAT-linked EVMs, adding that the Supreme Court in 2013 termed the second-generation EVMs as the ?safest?.Jaising said the EVMs compatible with VVPATs were used in Uttar Pradesh and Goa polls and the Election Commission of India has 13,000, apart from additional 3,000, second-generation EVMs with them.Raising concern over the EVM security, Jaising said: ?There is a demonstrable problem in Dholpur in Rajasthan -- no matter what button you press, the vote will go to the BJP.?The VVPAT is connected with EVMs and dispenses paper proof so that voters can verify that their vote has been cast correctly. The AAP and the Congress say that the EVMs without VVPAT can be tampered with. "
3732,Fire in electronics factory in Noida kills six,"Six employees of a factory that manufactured electronic goods were burnt to death after a fire engulfed a five-storey building in Noida?s Sector 11 on Wednesday.The incident was reported around 2.30pm at the factory that is located in F Block of Sector 11 near the Delhi-Noida border, police said. Some of the bodies recovered were charred beyond recognition.One of the employees, police said, sustained severe spinal injuries after he jumped down from the fifth floor.Employees, who survived the blaze, said that fire tenders reached the spot at least 90 minutes after the first call was made to the police. Fire department officials, however, rubbished the claims and said they rushed to the spot as soon as they were informed.The fire station is located just two kilometers away from the site of the incident in Sector 2. ?Twelve fire tenders, one 32 meters and another 42 meters hydraulic lift machines reached the spot within 30 minutes of being informed. It took us time to reach the spot because of traffic and encroachment on the road. Our Ghaziabad staff also reached the spot and lent us a helping hand,? said Aman Sharma, a fire department official. Initial estimates suggest that good sworth at least Rs 15 crore was gutted in the fire.Sources also said that the blaze also brought to the fore major lapses with regards to jurisdiction. Employees trapped inside the building said they kept calling 100 to inform Noida police about the incident but their call was diverted to neighbouring Delhi and Ghaziabad. A factory employee, Sheeshpal, said, that the fire broke out around 1pm. ?When we dialed 100, the call connected to Delhi police control room. Later, when we again tried to contact the police, the call connected to Ghaziabad police control room. After several attempts, we finally connected to Noida police control room,? he said. Sheeshpal said 12 employees worked in factory. ?It appears that fire started due to a short circuit on the third floor. We were trapped on the third floor after the blaze started. While four employees rushed upstairs after the blaze, the others rushed downstairs. One employee, Vivek, jumped from the fifth floor to escape the blaze,? said Ashish Kumar, another employee. The condition of Vivek is stated to be critical.?We swung into action as soon as we were informed about the fire. Over a dozen fire tenders were sent to the spot to douse the flames. Prima facie it appears that a short circuit may have triggered the fire,? said Aman Sharma, fire officer.Police said that the death toll may rise as there might be other bodies in the basement of the building."

3734,Man in Modi mask whips TN farmers in protest in Delhi,"For over a month now, Delhi has been witnessing a bizarre protest at Jantar Mantar. The protesters, who are farmers from Tamil Nadu, have used strategies never heard before ? from wearing skulls, eating mice, conducting mock funerals to even stripping at Raisina Hill. Adding to their eyeball popping agitation this week, a man dressed as Prime Minister Narendra Modi flogged the farmers with a whip.        The farmers said the idea was to show Centre?s ?insensitivity? to their plights. ?By ignoring us, it is like Modi is whipping us and trying to beat us out of Delhi? Sometimes I think if we get arrested it might be better. Jail would be better than this,? said P Ayyakkannu, the state president of the National South-Indian Rivers Linking Farmers? Association. At the outset, 25 farmers had volunteered to participate in the flogging, but soon after it began 23 of them backed out. One protester even reportedly fainted because of the pain.  Prakash, who carried out the flogging wore one of the popular Modi masks and was dressed in the PM?s trademark jacket and kurta.  A protester bites on to a mouse to depict loss of livelihood due to drought.

						 These farmers have been in Delhi for 37 days now and are in no mood to leave. Their protest  is aimed at getting a relief package from the Centre and having their loans waved off as their crops were ruined in a severe drought and a subsequent cyclone.  Their loans from cooperative banks have already been written off, under orders of the state government and the Madras High Court. They have also asked for revised drought packages, that would allow them to buy seeds for the next harvest cycle and also compensate their losses.Protesters use skulls and noose to depict suicides by their fellow farmers.

						With he mercury going up in the Capital, the protests have also become more  taxing.  Ayyakkannu shows us the blisters on his thighs from the heat. ?We are sleeping on hot tar while the PM sleeps in an air conditioned room?,? said Palanichamy, a farmer who has been at Jantar Mantar since the beginning of the protests.The farmers claim that they have not been able to meet the Prime Minister. ?This is how they are treating farmers; like slaves,? said Prakash, who used to work in marketing for rice products in Tamil Nadu, before coming over to join the farmers at Jantar Mantar.Protesters strip outside South Block after being unable to meet the President with their demands.

						The farmers have, though, met many political leaders, including  finance minister Arun Jaitley,  water resource minister Uma Bharti, home minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. However, Modi seems to be the one they want to meet. ?Modiji, Modiji. Jantar Mantar aaoji,? rings across the protest grounds.Meanwhile, they are not short of bizarre protest ideas yet. The next in line, is a literally ?deranged? act where they will try to showcase the impact of their current state.  By wearing torn clothes and acting unstable they will depict how they have ?lost their minds? in this long battle at Jantar Mantar. "

3737,Modi conspired against Advani: Lalu on Babri Masjid case,"The Supreme Court's revival of the conspiracy charge against BJP veteran LK Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case is itself a conspiracy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to remove the BJP veteran from the Presidential race, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad said today. ""The CBI is in the hands of the Prime Minister, and the CBI today said in court that the case of conspiracy should take place against Advani in the Babri case. Advani was tipped to become President this time. The PM has clipped Advani's chances of becoming the President. Anyone can understand that it is a political conspiracy of the Modi government to eliminate Advani from the race,"" Lalu said in Patna. The Presidential elections are due by July this year. Though the BJP has not announced any candidate yet, there are rumours of Advani, 89, as one of the front-runners. The RJD chief further said the conspiracy against Advani has been hatched despite him supporting Narendra Modi in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots. ""Advani supported Modi during the Gujarat riots. (The then Prime Minister Atal Bihari) Vajpayee asked Modi to follow the Raj Dharma, but Advani saved Modi,"" the Bihar leader said. Earlier today, the Supreme Court ruled Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh, Union Minister Uma Bharti, and others in the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad must face the conspiracy charge in the 1992 demolition case.

3738,Book reveals Clinton congratulated Trump after election,"As the first polls closed on 8 November, Hillary Clinton was preparing for the moment she would at long last take the stage as the first female president of the United States.She instead found herself apologizing to Barack Obama hours later in a harrowing phone call, moments after conceding the presidential election to Donald Trump.?Mr President, I?m sorry,? Clinton told Obama, who had contacted her to extend his condolences for her loss.The phone call is one of several revelations in the new book Shattered, in which the journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes chronicle Clinton?s 18-month quest to do what eluded her in 2008 and break ?that highest, hardest glass ceiling?.The book sheds particular light on the painful turn of events on election night, as Clinton watched the returns deviate dramatically from the path her campaign had so confidently predicted. Surrounded by family and aides at the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan, she saw the first cracks emerge as the must-win state of Florida turned dicey. Steve Schale, among the most reliable Democratic strategists in the state, informed Clinton?s campaign they were short on votes.As other battlegrounds began to crumble, a sober mood took hold in the suite. But soon, the authors wrote, aides began to blame each other as Bill Clinton grew increasingly upset and Hillary Clinton became withdrawn.It was Obama, taking in the results with his own advisers in Washington, who broke up the slumber with a series of phone calls from the White House. Wisconsin, a Democratic stronghold, had just been called for Trump. Some states remained excruciatingly close, but the president was convinced of the outcome and did not want to question the legitimacy of the election as Trump had done just weeks earlier while facing off against Clinton in the debates.?You need to concede,? Obama told Clinton after his political director had failed to persuade Clinton?s campaign manager, Robby Mook, on the point.It took one more phone call from the president ? to Clinton?s campaign chairman, John Podesta ? before she asked her close aide Huma Abedin for the phone and uttered the words she never thought she would say: ?Congratulations, Donald. ?I?ll be supportive of the country?s success, and that means your success as president,? Clinton said.It was after her brief conversation with Trump that Clinton apologized to Obama.The book is the second collaboration for Allen and Parnes, who in 2014 authored HRC, a detailed account of Clinton?s tenure at the helm of the state department, in anticipation of her second presidential run. As the first take on Clinton?s doomed campaign, they offer a behind-the-scenes view of the obstacles in her way ? some familiar and others a consequence of the shifting American electorate. There is the familiar tension between the old guard that has for decades operated ?Clintonworld? and the new blood that labored in Brooklyn to reinvent the campaign of one of the most well-known public figures in the world. The authors revisit the unexpected challenge from Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent campaign captured the wave of economic populism sweeping the country. The infighting amid the Democratic primaries, as Team Clinton struggled to decisively put away the senator, is a dominant theme of the book?s first half.And then there are the emails.The aftermath of Clinton?s decision to use a private email server as secretary of state, and subsequent discord among her inner circle over how to respond, is retold with the benefit of hindsight. We learn that Bill Clinton did not believe she should apologize, as neither he nor she felt there had been any wrongdoing.Clinton eventually did apologize to the public in August 2015, six months after the server issue was first brought to light.The role of Russian interference in the US election, now the subject of three investigations in Washington, is barely explored in the book, although the authors do say that Clinton?s former aides see it as one of the main reasons for her loss.The effects of Trump?s nationalist campaign are also relegated to the backseat, as this is a story primarily told through how Clinton?s campaign adapted (or sometimes crucially didn?t) to the evolving political climate. Staffers were confident in their sophisticated voter modeling and analytics, and fatally failed to spot when they veered off target.Clinton, for her part, carried a lingering doubt throughout the campaign. ?Why aren?t they with me?? she asked of working class white people during the Democratic primaries. ?Why can?t we bring them onboard??It was a question her campaign never quite answered."

3740,Delhi Metro to get 'driverless' trains in June,"Come June and you will be able to travel on the swanky new trains of the Delhi metro, which can also run without drivers. Passengers travelling between Noida and Kalkaji are likely to be the first one to experience the travel with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) scheduled to complete the work on this section of phase-III in May.It will then apply for inspection, which usually takes a month, which means the line can be opened for public by June.The new trains will run on two new lines - Pink (Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri west) and will cover a distance of 96 km. Delhi metro has also ordered 516 coaches (86 trains). These trains will run only on these two lines and cannot be integrated with the other existing lines. These trains have many unique features, which sets it apart from existing trains.Trials between Botanical Garden in Noida and Kalkaji Mandir (13 kilometres) in Delhi had started on October 27 last year while trial runs between Terminal 1-IGI airport and Janakpuri west (10KM) began on December 21. Track laying is nearing completion in the remaining underground section between Terminal 1 ? IGI Airport and Kalkaji Mandir and trials will be started on this section also in the coming months.?Since the signalling system and trains are new, we need at least six months of trial run. The mandatory tenure is completed for the Botanical Garden-Kalkaji section and after opening the Heritage Line (ITO-Kashmere Gate), we will start the process for this section,? said a DMRC official.The new trains, with extremely high levels of automation, had to undergo rigorous trials between these stations to ensure that they are ready for smooth operations after the commissioning of the corridor. Initially, train operators will run the trains, but gradually, driverless operations (on the Unattended Train Operation or UTO mode) will be possible.During the trial runs, the interface of the metro train was checked to ensure that there was no physical infringement with civil infrastructure and the various subsystems of coaches were also tested.Later on, in stages, the new signalling technology was implemented on this corridor; the Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) had to undergo rigorous testing. The response of the train at different speeds, braking and the interconnection with the Operations Control Centre (OCC) was also monitored during the trials. The behaviour of the track system and the Over Head Electrification (OHE) was checked repeatedly.This particular section from Botanical Garden till Kalkaji Mandir consists of nine elevated stations ? Botanical Garden, Okhla Bird sanctuary, Kalindi Kunj, Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh, Okhla Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Sukhdev Vihar, Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir. Work on all stations has been completed and finishing activities are in progress."

The court also ordered a time-bound trial, ordering that the judge hearing the case shall not be transferred until a judgement is delivered and that there shall be adjournments during the trial except under exceptional circumstances. The Allahabad High Court had earlier ruled in favour of the conspiracy charges being dropped against the veteran BJP leaders, including Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Union minister Uma Bharti. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is prosecuting the Babri demolition cases, had appealed against the high court's order.The Supreme Court today allowed the CBI's appeal and also ordered the clubbing of two trials that are currently going on in the Babri demolition case. The case against Advani, Joshi and Bharti was being heard in a Raebareli court while a Lucknow court was hearing a case against unnamed karsevaks who are accused to actually demolishing the Babri masjid on December 6, 1992. However, the apex court has now ordered the clubbing of the two cases, ruling that the Lucknow court will also rule on the conspiracy charges against Advani, Joshi, Bharti and others. The bench of Justices PC Ghose and RF Nariman also ruled that the trial judge hearing the Babri case will not be transferred until the judgement in the case is delivered. The bench also ruled that Kalyan Singh, currently the governor of Rajasthan, enjoys constitutional immunity and won't be tried right now. Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh at the time of the demolition, will be tried once he relinquishes the post of governor.

3744,Govt must be fined for allowing Art of Living fest: Sri Sri,"Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday said the Centre, Delhi government and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) should be held responsible for allowing his foundation to organise the World Culture Festival on the Yamuna floodplains in March 2016 ? if any environmental damage was caused.?If, at all, any fine has to be levied, it should be levied on the Central and state governments and the NGT itself, for giving the permission. If the Yamuna was so fragile and pure, they should have stopped the World Culture Festival,? said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in a statement issued on Tuesday. The tribunal had allowed the festival on March 11-13, 2016, saying that as the matter was ?fait accompli?, they could not ban it. The three-day World Cultural Festival of Art of Living soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and harming the ecosystems at the Yamuna floodplains.An interim environment compensation of Rs5 crore was imposed on the foundation for its alleged ?environment damaging activities? by the NGT while efforts were made to ascertain the exact cost of the damage.?World over, cultural programmes are held on riverbanks. The whole idea was to bring awareness to save the river. The Art of Living that has rejuvenated 27 rivers, planted 71 million trees, revived several ponds is being projected as destroying a dead river. What a joke,? said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.Even though the petitioner in the case and convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, Manoj Misra, chose to reserve his comments on Tuesday, he had earlier said: ?I have already stated in the petition submitted to the NGT that any activity on the Yamuna floodplains would be violating the green court?s earlier order and would prove detrimental to the floodplain.? ?The Art of Living had obtained all the necessary permission including the NGT?s. The NGT had the application file for two months and they could have stopped it in the beginning. It defies all principles of natural justice that you give permissions and slap a fine for not violating any rules,? the statement read. An expert panel, headed by Shashi Shekhar, secretary of ministry of water resources, submitted a report to the NGT, stating that it would take more than Rs 42 crore and at least 10 years to rehabilitate the floodplain after the damage caused by the three-day festival in March 2016.?I invite all honest environmentalists to study the case and unveil the truth,? he said."

3754,Ultralight paper device can be charged with body movements,"Washington, Apr 17 (PTI) Inspired by the Chinese and Japanese arts of paper-cutting, scientists have developed a light-weight, paper-based device that can harvest energy from body movements to power sensors and watches. Despite the many advances in portable electronic devices, one thing remains constant - the need to plug them into a wall socket to recharge. Portable electronic devices, such as watches, hearing aids and heart monitors, often require only a little energy. They usually get that power from conventional rechargeable batteries. Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology in the US and Chongqing University in China wanted to see if they could untether small energy needs from the wall socket by harvesting energy from a users body movements. They have been working on this approach in recent years, creating triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that can harness the mechanical energy all around us, such as that created by our footsteps, and then use it to power portable electronics. However, most TENG devices take several hours to charge small electronics, such as a sensor, and they are made of acrylic, which is heavy. Researchers turned to an ultra-light, rhombic paper-cut design a few inches long and covered it with different materials to turn it into a power unit. The four outer sides, made of gold- and graphite-coated sand paper, comprised the devices energy-storing supercapacitor element. "

He is a once in a generation bowler and you have got to harness that amazing talent,"" Lee said in an interview at a Mumbai hotel overlooking the Arabian Sea.The 23-year-old right-armer showed good control and generated enough pace even on the docile surfaces in India to trouble the hosts' batsmen.James Pattinson has also been in stellar form in domestic cricket since returning from a 12-month injury layoff in February and the 26-year-old could complete a dream pace quartet for the five-match Ashes series starting in November.Lee, an ambassador for Bowling Master, said he would struggle to summon the courage to face such a pace battery.""I would be (scared), absolutely,"" Lee said after launching the cricket training kit which will be sold on Amazon's India portal.""It's a pretty serious pace barrage that you've got. Australian bowling stocks now are pretty healthy.""Hazlewood is more of hitting the good length, day in and day out. With Starc you will be full, short, good length, yorkers, the whole thing.""Two completely different bowlers but complementing each other because they are building pressure from each end. Then you throw in someone like a Pat Cummins. It's a pretty handy attack.""Less than six months ago, Australia were still reeling from their 3-0 whitewash in Sri Lanka when they were beaten in the home series by South Africa with a match to spare.The axe fell on some players and a revamped side gained a consolation win at Adelaide Oval before going on to blank Pakistan 3-0 in the following series.They impressed one and all in India, going down 2-1 after a closely-fought four-match series against the world's top ranked test side.Lee said Smith now had the players to build a team around for the long-term.""After (former captain) Michael Clarke, you got Steve Smith taking over, and I think he's building his own team, which is a terrific team,"" said the 40-year-old.""It's a team that are very close and a team that's going to be around for a long time now.

Singh said during the election campaign the members of political outfits had gone to the headquarter of Gurmit Ram Rahim Singh headed sect ""to seek support and blessings"" which was ""against the Sikh ethics and customs"". He said the head of the sect was held guilty by Akal Takht for various blasphemous acts which had hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community by and large across the globe. Members (particularly Sikhs) of various political parties including Congress, SAD and AAP who were asked to appear before the Akal Takht, since being a Sikh no one could visit sect headquarter especially when the community was asked by it to boycott the tainted sect, Singh said.

3759,FIR ordered against woman cop for sexually assaulting girl,"A Delhi court has ordered an FIR against a woman police officer for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor girl, who had earlier accused her teacher of molesting her. The Delhi Police, however, said they will begin internal probe in the matter and challenge the order in high court if the charges were found to be false.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, on Monday, passed the order after the 13-year-old girl told the court that she was sexually assaulted by the woman investigating officer (IO) of the case and she had lodged a complaint with the police against her but no action was taken.The court also dismissed the third bail plea of the teacher of a government school, facing prosecution in the case, saying there was no change in circumstances.?Today, separate directions have been given for lodging of FIR against the IO in this case for having committed penetrative sexual assault upon the child victim and creating false evidence.?Needless to say, false evidence was being created by the IO solely to accord benefit thereof to the applicant/accused Manoj Rathi (teacher). Be that as it may, I do not find any change in the circumstance warranting taking different view. The bail application of the applicant accordingly stands dismissed,? the judge said.The court directed the SHO of Mangolpuri in north west Delhi to get the FIR registered against woman IO, a sub-inspector, through a senior officer and file a status report in the matter on April 29.Senior police officers, however, said that they were yet to receive a copy of the court order. They said the court?s order will be examined by their legal department. ?We will defend the woman investigating officer if the charges against her are found baseless. For this, we will challenge the city court?s order in the high court. But if the charges are found true, we will certainly register a case against the woman officer and take strictest possible action under law,? the officer said. The officer said that the court has asked them to file the status report on February 29. ?We still have 10 days to complete our internal enquiry, take legal opinion and decide our further course of action,? the officer said.The girl, in her complaint, alleged that the IO had threatened her father to get the victim medically re-examined or she would implicate her in a false case.The child alleged that initially the woman official sexually assaulted her and later took her to a hospital where the doctors conducted her internal medical examination without her consent.The police which is already probing the aspect of sexual assault on the minor by her teacher, had earlier informed the court that it has also registered an FIR against the girl?s father in view of the alleged confession letter which was given to the police by the school staff.The school staff had given to police an alleged confession letter of the girl?s father that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted her.The initial incident occurred in August last year when the girl, a Class V student of a government school in Aman Vihar area of North-West Delhi, asked a question to the teacher who told her to meet him alone later.The girl said in her complaint that the teacher allegedly molested her and when her parents came to the school next day to complain about his conduct, he threatened them and took thumb impression of the child?s father on a blank paper.The teacher then allegedly wrote a confession letter on behalf of the girl?s father that he had repeatedly sexually assaulted his daughter and got the signatures of other colleagues, she had alleged. Later, a case under the POCSO Act was registered by the police against the accused teacher.The police have also lodged a case against other school teachers and principal for not informing them about an alleged confession letter of a minor girl?s father.(With PTI inputs)"
3760,Ganga tunnel of East West Metro is 1st of its kind: Minister,"Kolkata, Apr 17 (PTI) The underwater tunnel of East-West Metro Corridor Project here, built below the Ganga river bed, is the first of its kind in the country, said Union Minister Babul Supriyo today after going into the tunnel. ""This is the first such project in the country. Building a tunnel under the river had never taken place elsewhere in India. Further being built under Ganga, it has an emotional value as well,"" Supriyo, who went inside the tunnel between slab numbers 820 and 840, said. He has been asked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to personally supervise the work, said Supriyo while interacting with the officials of Afcons-Transtonnelstroy of South Africa, the agency to build the tunnel between Howrah Maidan and the proposed Mahakaran metro station near Writers Buildings here. Supriyo also collected soil from the place and kept it in two utensils - one for gifting to the prime minister and another for himself as a memento. The entire stretch of tunnel from Howrah Maidan to the Ganga bank in the city will be 1.7 km, of which a significant part will be on the surface. ""Basically, we reached almost the bottom of the Ganga and spent a considerable time (there). It was an exhilarating experience. I salute the engineers and the workers for the heroic work,"" Supriyo, the Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises said. Asked about the safety of the project, he said ""Let me allay any apprehension about the safety. We did not feel uncomfortable inside though we were 32 m below the river water - that is the sea level."" He said the tunnel went under buildings like Howrah Station but there were no threat to them as the latest technology had been used. The tunnel boring machine (TBM), used in the excavation work, will now go beyond the slab number 840 to dig up earth under the river bed and finally reach the east bank - that is the city. Expressing hope that the Howrah Maidan-Esplanade part of Phase II of the project, which would connect Howrah Maidan to Sealdah) will not miss the deadline, Supriyo said ""We expect to clear the logjam in the wake of the existing rule that infrastructure projects would not come up within 100 m of the heritage buildings."" ""There are three heritage constructions - two synagogues and the Currency Building within 30 m of the proposed tunnel. But IIT-Kharagpur in a feasibility study said the tunnel work and metro movement would not cause any damage to the structures."" ""We are not setting up a time-frame and the Union cabinet is preparing a note to exempt the Metro work. Lets hope for the best,"" he said. The entire second phase of the East West Project, with 100 per cent funding by the Centre, had been facilitated by the West Bengal government with intervention by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her cabinet colleagues to clear settlements. Phase 1 of the East-West Metro Corridor Project, he said, is expected to be completed on time and thanked Banerjee for removing encroachments along the route. ""During my chance meeting with the West Bengal CM in 2015 which the media had christened as Jhalmuri diplomacy, I had broached the topic of encroachment and with the intervention of TMC leaders it was resolved. ""The encroachers will be relocated in a new building in the area,"" he said. "

Sathyaraj as the salve warlord Katappa, is one of the most important characters in The Conclusion.""I worked with Sathyaraj for almost five years and I could have never ever imagined he is a person who could try to hurt someone. Some videos were posted on the internet. When we started inquiring, we learned that whatever comments Mr Sathyaraj made it was nine years back. And after that, about 30 films of his were released in Karnataka. Baahubali 1 released. No one had problems with that. And suddenly, raking up the issue at this point in time is not right,"" he said.Rana Daggubati, who plays the mighty Bhallala Deva, also reacted to the issue. He said, ""That's something he (Sathyaraj) said 10 years ago. Baahubali part 1 released in Karnataka and everybody loved it. It was huge in Karnataka. I mean, they're just trying to make news again.""Made on a lavish budget of Rs 250 crore, Baahubali is touted to have earned more than Rs 500 crore even before its release through its satellite and distribution rights.Directed by SS Rajamouli, Baahubali 2 takes the story forward from where Baahubali: The Beginning ended.

3763,Air India to fine unruly flyers up to ?15L for flight delay,"Passengers delaying flights beyond two hours in an air rage could be fined Rs 15 lakh, says national carrier Air India?s proposed set of standard operating procedures to tackle unruly flyers.The draft SOPs detail steps for the crew and ground staff in the event of ugly incidents such as two recent controversies involving parliamentarians Ravindra Gaikwad of the Shiv Sena and Trinamool Congress?s Dola Sen.Gaikwad was banned from flying by six airlines after he assaulted a senior Air India official with his slippers, allegedly angry over the state-run carrier shifting him from business class to economy on a Pune-New Delhi flight this March. But his name was struck off the ?no-fly? list 10 days ago after political intervention.Air India says the Gaikwad incident caused a flight delay of 90 minutes. Similarly, Trinamool?s Sen had an argument with the cabin crew and delayed the flight for 39 minutes.. @airindian prepares SOP to handle 'unruly passengers'. To levy fine upto R 15 lakh, in case they delay the flight. @htTweets @htdelhi? Faizan Haidar (@FaiHaider) April 17, 2017The proposal lists six steps to tackle similar situations, including informing the airport manager, no direct interaction with media, immediate filing of police complaint, assessment of damage, and fining a misbehaving flier in accordance with the amount of delay.If a rowdy passenger causes a delay of up to an hour, he will have to pay a penalty of Rs 5 lakh. For delays between one and two hours, the fine is Rs 10 lakh; and Rs 15 lakh for beyond two hours.An internal communication of the airline says such incidents should be prevented as these affect the crew?s morale.?The proposal from the commercial department has been forwarded to the legal team. After the legal opinion, we will notify it. In between, we hope the definition of unruly passengers will be out. Otherwise, we will define it,? an Air India official said on Monday.The fine could be symbolic, though.?Even a roadside hotel has a board saying ?right to admission reserved?. Air India, thus, must have a procedure for handling unruly passengers. Further, recent incidents have revealed that unruly behaviour does not require any provocation,? the proposal says.Hundreds of flyers ? mostly drunk, petulant or arrogant ? have been grounded, blacklisted, arrested, fined and imprisoned for their aggressive behaviour since aviation became an accessible and favoured mode of transport around the world.Last December, a Citibank vice-president and his girlfriend were arrested in America for fighting with the flight crew and fellow passengers.Back home, a police complaint was lodged against Gaikwad, the Sena MP for Osmanabad, who had bragged before television camera that he hit the Air India employee with his slippers 25 times.Air India retaliated by blocking seven attempts he made to book a ticket, changing the spelling of his surname and using prefixes such as Prof. He was forced to travel by train.All six airlines cited passenger safety as a reason for banning him from flying.Gaikwad didn?t face any police action. Instead, Air India lifted the travel ban as the central government intervened. He expressed regret for the incident, but did not apologise.The Shiv Sena, an ally of the ruling BJP at the Centre and Maharashtra, held him clean and threatened to stop all flights from Mumbai and skip a meeting of the NDA if the ban was not revoked. Also, Sena parliamentarians created a ruckus in Parliament."

3770,"Ola, Uber drivers to go on strike in Delhi","Brace for higher cab fares and longer waits on Tuesday as drivers? of online cab aggregators Ola and Uber are going to start round two of their protest. Though a one-day strike, the protest could severely hit the private transport service sector in Delhi-NCR as this time even the rivals of Ola-Uber drivers, kaali-peeli taxi operators, have joined hands.While most taxi and autorickshaw drivers, of an estimated 1-5 lakh app-based taxis in Delhi-NCR, have decided not to take out their vehicles on April 18, they also plan to do a protest march to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal?s residence in Civil Lines from the Majnu Ka Tila Gurudwara. The drivers have renewed the stir as they feel their demands have fallen on deaf ears ? ?neither the companies nor the Delhi government has done anything,? they claim. In February, Delhi-NCR got its first taste of a strike by Ola-Uber drivers against the cab aggregator companies, which impacted lakhs of commuters for almost two weeks. Leading the fresh protest is the same drivers? union, Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi (SDAD), which had organised the previous strike.?Nothing has changed since our February protest. Drivers continue to slog for 16-18 hours daily and still are barely earning enough to eat and pay the car EMIs. Fares of registered city taxis can only be fixed by the government, whereas, Ola-Uber still continue to levy their own rates,? said Kamaljeet Gill, president SDAD.Foes turn friendsTuesday?s strike has received support from at least a dozen transport unions active in the capital.Until now, drivers of kaali-peeli taxis, those with All India Taxi Permit (AITP) and auto-rickshaws had always protested against the Ola-Uber drivers for eating away into their earnings as the app-based cab service gained huge popularity.?Drivers of Ola-Uber are suffering because they are working like bonded labourers and are earning pittance. Like we have always been demanding, they also want meters installed in cabs and rates to be fixed by the government. Our issues have now become common and so we will fight together,? said Sanjay Samrat of Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association. He added that the app-based cab companies are flouting not only laws but also directions issued by the Supreme Court. ?Cabs are illegally being run on shared basis. Ola and Uber are giving away cars with AIT permits to drivers on a small down payment of R 35,000. As per the law, vehicles with these permits cannot be run on point-to-point basis,? Samrat said."

The video that was put on YouTube two days ago has since been shared widely on social media.All political parties and their leader should keep India first, says 47-year-old Vishwas, who is also a poet.?If you form government in Delhi on an anti-corruption plank and fall silent when some of your own come under scanner, people have the right to question you,? he says.Recently, some AAP leaders have been accused of corruption and nepotism by a panel that looked into a string of decisions taken by the Kejriwal government.The CBI is examining accusations of money laundering against Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain.In his ?India first? message, Vishwas also questions the ?personality cult? and goes on to draw a parallel between Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Yogi Adityanath.?Whether it is Modi, Rahul, Yogi or Kejriwal...it is about five years, 10 years or 25 years. But India is beyond this and will be there for thousands of years,? Vishwas says, triggering talk of infighting in AAP.Kejriwal tweeted the video on Saturday, saying the video was wonderful and everyone should watch it.???? ?????? ?????? ???? ?? ???? ???? ??? ????? ?????? https://t.co/0pIOm401T9?

He is family...its (talks of Kumar being unhappy) media creation. Tomorrow media will say my wife has targeted me,? Kejriwal said in an interview to CNN News 18, a clip of which was also retweeted by the CM.Defending his government?s record on corruption, the chief minister said he had been ruthless and had sacked ministers, whenever credible evidence was put forward.Vishwas is one of the popular faces of AAP and is also on the list of the so-called star campaigners for the municipal elections but has so far stayed away from electioneering."

3776,"Lived in slum, used public toilet to get Company role: Vivek","#NotAllStarKids, the hashtag would read, if social media got wind of what Vivek Oberoi had to go through to bag the now-iconic role of Chandu in Ram Gopal Varma's 2002 film Company and made the story viral. Unlike the popular belief that industry kids get it easy, turns out it was not easy for Vivek Oberoi to convince RGV that he could pull off the character of Chandu.Company, which completed 15 years this week, is one of Bollywood's most iconic gangster films of all time. Written by Jaideep Sahni (who later went on to write Chak De! India) and directed by Ram Gopal Varma, Company was a fictional retelling of the bloody, real-life rivalry between crime bosses, Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan.Fifteen years ago, Vivek Oberoi made his Bollywood debut with Company. Unlike conventional industry-kid debut vehicles which happen to be romantic films, Vivek Oberoi opted for a gritty, gangster film which was a risky career choice. But the film wowed critics and audiences alike and the rest is history.Speaking about how he got the role, Vivek Oberoi spoke to Hindustan Times and said, ""My father was planning to launch me in an Abbas Mustan film. But I always wanted to become an actor on my own, so I told him that I would like to go through my struggle. So I went to RGV sir's office, and told him to give me an audition for the role of Chandu. He did not know (then) that I was Suresh Oberoi's son. I told him my name was Vivek Anand. He told me I look too good for the role, and he wanted to cast someone who looked like a gangster from the slums.""Then, Vivek apparently asked for fifteen days from Ram Gopal Varma. He began staying in slums, sleeping on floors with mice roaming about, using public toilets and so on. Slowly, he began to look the part...""On the day, I was supposed to meet him, I took out some mud from a plant at his office and applied it on my face. I walked into his room, with a beedi in my mouth - I sat on the chair and kept my legs on his desk, and said, ' Ey yeh thobda kya dekh raha hai'. That convinced him,"" Vivek said.Vivek Oberoi also did a lot of stunts in the film despite acting in a movie for the first time.""I wanted to do everything, and I loved doing all the stunts. There was a sequence, in which I had to run for my life, jumping from one building to another in the bylanes of Kenya. For a steep jump, RGV had asked the stuntman to do it, and after he had finished the shot, RGV left. I, then persuaded the stunt director to shoot the same scene with me,"" Vivek said."

3786,Porn clip plays on a screen at Delhi's Rajiv Chowk station,"Commuters at the busy Rajiv Chowk Metro station in central Delhi?s Connaught Place were left shocked when a pornographic clip played on an LED screen for around 10 minutes.The screen, that was installed on April 9 and is meant to display advertisements, started playing a porn video all of a sudden, eyewitnesses said. The video continued for several minutes and was stopped only after some commuters brought it to the attention of DMRC officials at the station.The incident was recorded by several commuters on their mobile phones and has been shared multiple times on various social media platforms, forcing the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to initiate an inquiry. DMRC said three unidentified men may have played the clip on the big screen as the system is not secure.Anuj Dayal, the DMRC spokesperson, said after preliminary investigations, it has been established that the incident took place around 5pm on April 9. ?The LED TV system was being commissioned and its Wi-Fi port was accessible. Prima facie, as per CCTV footage, three men played the porn clip through their mobile (phone) on this TV at Rajiv Chowk station. Attempts are being made to identify these men. CCTV footage is under examination to identify the culprits,? said Dayal.?This sort of interference with the system will not be possible in the future once the software is programmed and centrally controlled. In the interim, during the commissioning process, the contractor will be advised to ensure password protection,? Dayal added.A video of the area, recorded by a commuter, showed most people walk past the screen either clueless or unbothered. A few others, however, stopped by to record the unusual activity on their mobile phones. A few of them then alerted the DMRC officials who rushed into action to turn off the broadcast.Delhi Police, meanwhile, said they have not received any complaint from the DMRC in this connection. ?If the DMRC approaches us after completing their internal probe, we will go ahead with the legal proceedings,? said a senior police officer.?The objective of the LED screens is to disseminate information to passengers through various multimedia tools,? said another DMRC spokesperson.A similar incident had been reported from Wayanad district in Kerala in 2015. Hundreds of passengers waiting at a bus stand in Kalpetta then had seen a porn video playing on a television installed to broadcast advertisements. A witness had later shared the video of the spot on social media. The user reported that the clip had played for 30 minutes .

When I felt so overwhelmed and so isolated and just needed to cry, I would grab him into his conference room and he would just sit there with me and be like, ?We?re going to get through this and we want to get through it with you?. He did it over and over.?Sandberg?s latest book, Option B, written with psychologist Adam Grant, explores her grief at the loss of Goldberg and acts as a manual for how to build resilience and achieve ?post-traumatic growth?. She wrote the book after posting a highly personal account of her first month as a widow on Facebook. The post attracted a huge outpouring of support and more than 74,000 comments to date. ?After that, I didn?t feel so alone,? she said.Sandberg described how her self-confidence had been shattered after the death of her husband, and that she had needed building up by colleagues including Zuckerberg. She described panicking to him about getting something wrong, and feeling better when he replied: ?Really? I thought you made a good point in that meeting and helped us make a better decision.? The executive, who started dating her old friend and tech billionaire Bobby Kotick 10 months after the death of her husband, also spoke about her anger towards people who judge widows who date again.One Facebook user called her a ?garbage whore?, while another said she was ?one classy lady? for ?already sharing fluids with a nice guy?. ?I?m hoping that this book helps people stop judging people who date [after the loss of a partner], particularly women, because women get judged more harshly,? she said. ?Men date sooner, men date more, and women get judged more. And, you know, obviously that?s super unfair.?She added: ?I think I?m helping people remember that dating, for those that want to do it, is part of moving forward, and it?s option B. If I could, I would only date Dave. I made that choice. I just had it taken away from me.?In the book ? for which she studied the research of behavioural scientists, neurologists and psychologists for tips on how to build resilience ? Sandberg offers practical methods for dealing with grief. These include writing down three joyful experiences and three things done well every day.The author of Lean-In admitted becoming more distanced from friends after the loss of her partner. Asked if she had been let down by loved ones, she replied: ?I don?t know anyone who?s been through this who hasn?t had friends who disappointed them. I think we all go through that.?But the process of dealing with the loss of her husband and best friend had given her life a deeper meaning, and more perspective on life?s difficulties, she said. ?I would definitely choose to be before, so I could get Dave back. I?d give up all the growth. But the deeper sense of meaning, gratitude, purpose ? those things are wonderful things.?Read the full interview and an exclusive extract from Option B in Weekend magazine "

Well, Shahid himself thought he was a superstar but unfortunately, the editor of a popular film magazine had to disagree.According to Rajeev Masand's latest column in Open Magazine, it all began when Shahid Kapoor did a photoshoot for the cover of a 'popular film glossy' a few days before the release of his film Rangoon. The issue was supposed to hit the stands a couple of weeks after the film's release.When the magazine's team sent Shahid a scan of the feature story, before the issue was sent to the press for printing, Shahid apparently 'balked', according to the magazine's editor. Shahid, reportedly, did not like being called a 'star' in the story's headline and demanded that 'star' should be changed to 'superstar'. Shahid said that if the magazine team did not want to make the change, he wanted the entire story 'pulled'.Consequently, the magazine team made the required change and the edition was sent to the press for printing.But Rangoon finally released and flopped big time. The magazine's editor reportedly 'felt silly for indulging the actor's whims' and immediately ensured that the issue was called back in time so that the headline could be changed again. So, the new headline focused on Shahid Kapoor recently becoming a father."

3796,Only employer to decide if staff's work is satisfactory: HC,"New Delhi, Apr 13 (PTI) An employer, not a court, will decide whether a probationary employees services are satisfactory, the Delhi High Court has said. Justice Valmiki Mehta made the observation while upholding the termination of services of a teacher by a private school in the national capital. ""Whether or not a probationary employees services are satisfactory, it is for the employer to decide ..., and this court cannot substitute its view for that of the employer with respect to satisfactory services or otherwise of employee with the employer,"" the court said. The school had terminated the services of a teacher in March 2014 after keeping him on probation for nearly three years as his work was not found to be satisfactory. The teacher had challenged the decision in the Delhi School Tribunal (DST) which on December 10, 2015 had ruled in his favour by ordering his reinstatement. The school had challenged the DSTs decision in the high court which set aside the tribunals order, holding the termination of his service as valid. It said that since the man, who was appointed on April 4, 2011, did not complete three years of service in the school, he would not be entitled to be confirmed as an employee as was ruled by the Delhi High Court in another matter in 2013. While setting aside the tribunals decision, the high court also expressed surprise as to how the DST avoided direct reference to the 2013 decision of the high court. In its decision of 2013 in another service matter, the high court had held that the maximum period of probation can be three years, six years in gravest of grave cases, and there can be deemed confirmation of services only after that. The teacher was on probation from April 4, 2011 to March 5, 2014 when his services were terminated. He had contended that as per the terms and conditions of his service, the probationary period was not to exceed two years, but he was kept on probation for longer than that. "

3798,New tech uses glowing bacteria to safely detect landmines,"A team of researchers at an Israeli university has successfully tested a technology using fluorescent bacteria and lasers that could become a safer system for detecting buried landmines.An estimated 100m landmines are scattered in some 70 countries, a legacy of often long-past conflict, and the devices injure up to 20,000 people a year. Mine clearance work is typically dangerous, labour-intensive and costly.The team at Jerusalem?s Hebrew University has tested mine detection using bacteria genetically modified to give off a fluorescent signal when mines ? often made out plastic ? are close, which can then be detected with a laser.Reporting the findings in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers say their approach relies on tiny amounts of vapour given off by the explosives in the mines.It was recognised that some plants reacted to those vapours, and the research used modified bacteria that essentially glow in contact with the explosive vapour. Encased in polymer beads scattered on the suspected minefield, that fluorescence is then detected by a laser system that researchers suggest could be mounted on a vehicle ? including drones.The system has been successfully tested in a field of real landmines, scanning the ground at a rate of around 18cm per second ? a speed the researchers hope to increase.Belkin?s team is not the first to develop bacteria that glow in the presence of explosive vapour ? similar findings were reported by a team at Edinburgh University in 2009 ? but it appears to be the first to have developed a potentially functioning detection system using the technology.?Our field data show that engineered biosensors may be useful in a landmine detection system,? said Prof Shimshon Belkin, who headed the experiment. However, the technology would need to be developed further still, he added.?For this to be possible, several challenges need to be overcome, such as enhancing the sensitivity and stability of the sensor bacteria, improving scanning speeds to cover large areas, and making the scanning apparatus more compact so it can be used on board a light unmanned aircraft or drone.?The university said in a statement: ?This appears to be the first demonstration of a functional standoff landmine detection system.? A byproduct of the research by Belkin and his team was announced three years ago: the use of modified bacteria to detect pollutants in water, suggesting further applications for the technology. "
3799,Will set up Commission for SC/STs after MCD polls: Kejriwal,"As India celebrated Ambedkar Jayanti, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that his government would set up a commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes after the municipal polls.The move is being seen to woo the dalit community and sanitation workers ahead of the election on April 23.There are around 20 lakh dalits and Scheduled Castes in Delhi, making up for nearly 20 per cent of the city's electoral population of 12 million.After making the announcement, the CM while accepting AAP's defeat in Rajouri Garden constituency during bypolls said that people were not happy with the decision of Jarnail Singh's resignation to contest in Punjab's state elections."
3800,India must aspire to become global power of happiness: Prez,"By Laxmi Devi Bengaluru, Apr 14 (PTI) President Pranab Mukherjee today underscored the need for India to be a global powerhouse not just in terms of economic parameters but also Gross National Happiness. ""If we aspire to be one of the leading economic powers of the world, yes, we can be, but merely in statistical terms, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), in terms of skill are not adequate,"" Mukherjee said after laying the foundation stone for the Bengaluru Dr B R Ambedkar School of Economics here. The President said the concept of development has changed now and international organisations like the World Bank and IMF are talking about development in terms of GDP as well as Gross National Happiness (GNH). ""Along with GDP, GNH is considered as one of the important factors of development,"" Mukherjee emphasised. He expressed concern over unemployability of the youth in India, saying ""600 million youth are entering the job market, but their employability is not adequate"". "
