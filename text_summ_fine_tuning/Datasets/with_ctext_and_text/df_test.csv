3806,"Delhi Police has busted a module that sold information including bank account details and card details of over 1 crore people. Police have arrested an accused in the case, who allegedly sold this data at about 20 paisa per individual. The data was sold to fake call centres, which would use it to obtain victims' one-time passwords to steal money.","Delhi Police on Thursday said they had arrested a man who they claimed was in possession of the personal bank details of nearly 1 crore Indians.The accused, identified as 33-year-old Puran Gupta, would allegedly sell this data to fake call centres whose employees would in turn use it to call the targeted victims and obtain their one-time passwords (OTPs). Since the fake call centres already had other details related to the credit or debit cards, courtesy Gupta, the OTPs would help them in stealing money.Gupta was arrested from Ganesh Nagar on Monday after the southeast Delhi police began probing a complaint in which a senior citizen from Greater Kailash was duped of Rs 1.46 lakh by a caller who posed as a representative of Citibank and tricked him into revealing his OTP.?Much of the money stolen was transferred to e-wallets and online ewallets such as PayU, Paytm, Olacabs, Mobikwik and Vodafone Bill Pay,? said Romil Baaniya, DCP (southeast). Since the victim was quick to approach the police, the investigators immediately shot off letters to some of these firms. ?Our prompt action led to these firms returning almost Rs 72,000 of the duped amount,? said Baaniya. The police had earlier this month also arrested the owner of a fake call centre, Ashish Kumar Jha, who also used to trick senior citizens and duped their money. When questioned how he had obtained the victim?s credit card details and contact number, he named Gupta.That opened a can of worms. Once Gupta was arrested, a search of his laptop and emails revealed that he was in possession of the personal banking data of nearly one crore Indians. He had stored the data in different folders to meet the exact requirement of his clients.Some of these classifications were based on the age groups, monthly incomes and credit card limits, police said. ?The fake call centres found women and elderly people easy targets,? explained Baaniya as the reason for classification of the data.Apart from the credit and debit card details, Gupta was also found to be in possession of personal data of Delhi University students, lawyers, stock brokers, people interested in night life and those owning cars. He allegedly sold these data for as little as 10 paise per data.But the hot property was the credit and debit card details of people. Police are probing if employees of some banks helped him procure the data. ?He was buying the credit and debit card data for 40 paise per customer. Apart from the card numbers, expiry dates and CVVs, he was able to procure all details filled in the application forms by customers,? said another investigator.A former data entry operator, Gupta, had created a firm that appeared to be involved in data collection, data entry, data market research and online promotion. But he got his firm registered on JustDial which helped him offer the credit/debit card details to fake call centre operators who would call him for data, said the DCP."

3819,"To transform India's economy, it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy, Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy has said. Further, he said there is a need to reduce ""friction"" in businesses and create an ""environment"" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs. ","From Lalit K Jha Charlottesville (US), Apr 13 (PTI) To transform Indias economy, there is a need to reduce ""friction"" in businesses and create an ""environment"" wherein the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs, Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy has said. For the transformation of the Indian economy, he said it is essential for the younger generation to be daring and that India is integrated with the global economy. ""We still have a little bit of work in reducing friction to businesses. We need to create an environment where the government has more trust in its entrepreneurs than it is today,"" Murthy, 70, told students of the prestigious Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia here. Murthy, the recipient of the 2017 Thomas Jefferson Foundation medal in Global Innovation, was responding to Darden School of Business Dean Scott Beardsley who asked, ""what do you think needs to happen next to transform Indias economy. What is next"". ""We want our youngsters to be a little bit more daring in taking the entrepreneurial route more and more than the extent to which they do today. We have to become much more integrated to the world economy so that we can consider the entire world as our market and can become globally competitive. ""And most importantly we can become much more open minded to learn from the wonderful things that are happening in this country and elsewhere. I would say these are required (for transforming Indias economy to the next level),"" Murthy said. He, however, refrained from elaborating what the Indian government needs to do to create the environment of trust in its entrepreneurs and said, ""I will tell you why, as an Indian citizen, it may not be proper if I were to be critical about India when I am outside India"". Interacting with students, he said, challenges for entrepreneurs are now different than the time when he started Infosys. Those days access to capital was almost non-existent and government was a big irritant. ""Today, challenges are different. But in some sense even more complex, because todays entrepreneurs have to be much more smarter than what we were because there is so much of competition on a global scale. Before you can say this can be done, somebody else may have already done it. ""Therefore, todays entrepreneurs would have to be much more nimble, global, competitive because market is truly determinant for success today unlike our time when managing government was a big determinant in India,"" he said. Murthy said good governance is all about maximising shareholders value while ensuring fairness, transparency and accountability to all stake holders. Of all the stakeholders, society is the most important player. ""Respect from the society is the most important ingredient for longevity of a corporation,"" he said. ""To be honoured by the most innovative country in the world and to be awarded a medal in the name of Thomas Jefferson, author of Declaration of Independence is to me a big honour. I will certainly work hard, and hopefully smart in the remaining years of my life, to deserve this kindness, this generosity and this affection on their part,"" he told PTI. The fact that the university has seen it fit to pick up somebody from India, and bestow this honour shows how open this country is and how generous they are, Murthy said. ""Therefore this is a clear example of how Indian students wherever they are whether in India or here or anywhere else can be sure that as long as they are good citizens of this world, contribute to make the society a better place through peaceful and harmonious methods, they will be recognised, appreciated,"" he said. Murthy said that Indian students are making a positive impact in the countries they are studying. "

3824,"The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, wherein thousands of people in a public protest meeting were fired upon under the command of Brigadier-General Dyer. While British officials declared 379 deaths in the massacre, the Indian National Congress estimated over 1,000 deaths. Dyer stated that the firing was to 'punish the Indians for disobedience'.","It was exactly 98 years ago that the ghastly Jallianwala Bagh massacre had taken place on Baisakhi. However, Britain, which colonised India for 200 years, is yet to tender an apology for the incident and similar such excesses committed by its forces on the native people.While Canada has apologised for the 1914 Komagata Maru incident and Japan has said sorry to South Korea over the Korean women forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during the World War II, the UK has yet to express any such sentiments.The Jallianwala Bagh massacre had taken place in Amritsar on April 13, 1919. On hearing that a meeting of nearly 20,000 people was taking place at Jallianwala Bagh, Brigadier General REH Dyer had ordered 50 riflemen to shoot at the crowd.More than 1,000 innocent Indians were killed and over 1,100 injured. Though Britain has described the incident as ""shameful"", it has fallen far short of tendering an apology.In 2013, former British Prime Minister David Cameron described the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as a ""deeply shameful event"". But he did not apologise for it.MERE LIP SERVICE, NO APOLOGY YET FROM BRITAINEarlier, during their ceremonial visit to Jallianwala Bagh in 1997, Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh merely signed on the visitor's book. They did not leave any comment, leave aside, even regretting the incident.Congress MP and author Shashi Tharoor is of the view that the Jallianwala Bagh centenary in 2019 would be a ""good time"" for the UK to apologise to Indians for the excesses committed during their 200-odd rule.While speaking on his book 'An Era of Darkness: The British Empire In India' before inaugurating the Kolkata Literary Festival-2017, had said, ""Either the British Prime Minister or a member of the royal family can come and convey their own profound apologies to the people of India, not just for that atrocity (Jallianwala Bagh massacre) but for all wrongs done during the empire.""Tharoor pointed out that one cannot quantify the wrongs done by the Britishers. He is of the opinion that an apology would be far more important than any financial compensation.CANADA APOLOGISED FOR 1914 KOMAGATA MARU INCIDENTWhile it is still uncertain whether the Britishers would act contrite for the excesses committed by them, Canada apologised for the 1914 Komagata Maru incident where hundreds of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim immigrants were denied entry into that country and turned away from the port of Vancouver to return to an uncertain and ultimately violent fate in India.In May 2016, almost 102 years after Canada turned away over 376 migrants, mostly Sikhs from India, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally apologised in Parliament for the ""great injustice"" that had happened due to discriminatory laws of the time.Trudeau apologised in the House of Commonsfor the 1914 decision by the then Canadian government to turn away the migrants onboard the ship Komagata Maru after their arrival in Vancouver.Komagata Maru sailed into Vancouver harbour on May 23, 1914 from Hong Kong, but most of the passengers were eventually turned away on the grounds of the ""continuous journey clause"" that allowed only travellers on a trip without interruption to land in Canada.After two months in limbo in the harbour, the ship was escorted out of the harbour by the military. It returned to India and on its arrival, at least 19 people were killed in a skirmish with British soldiers, while others were jailed.JAPAN'S APOLOGY TO SOUTH KOREA FOR COMFORT WOMENIn December 2015, Japan apologised to South Korea for having forced the latter's women into sexual slavery during the World War II. The Korean women had been enslaved by Japan for its soldiers.Japan had colonised Korea from 1910-45.The sensitive issue had remained a sore point in relations between the two East Asian countries for decades before they reached a landmark deal. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued a statement to apologise and express remorse ""from the heart for all the people suffering hard-to-cure wounds and many pains"" physically and psychologically.He had said in the comfort women issue, many women under the then military's involvement bore deep scars to their honour and dignity. From this perspective, his statement said, the Japanese government acutely feels responsible.Besides expressing its regret, contrition and apology for its colonial-era sexual enslavement of Korean women, Japan also agreed to provide 1 billion yen ($8.3 million) for a foundation to be established by South Korea to support the surviving victims.WILLY BRANDT APOLOGY FOR NAZI CRIMESIn December 1970, German social democrat leader Willy Brandt went on his knees in front of the monument to the Jews who had rebelled in the Warsaw Ghetto.Though he was in no way related to the crimes of the Nazis, Brandt apologised on their behalf during a visit to Poland.Shashi Tharoor and the likes of him would only hope that the UK takes a cue from Canada, Japan and Germany to apologise to India for the inhuman treatment of the native people during their rule.

He can appeal to the Pakistan's Military Appellate Tribunal or appeal in a civilian court for a review of the judgment. Earlier, Pakistan Defence Minister said Jadhav had 60 days to appeal.","Former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav was today awarded capital punishment by a military court in Pakistan.The Field General Court Martial (FGCM) sentenced Kulbhushan Jadhav to death on the charges of ""espionage and sabotage activities"". FGCM is a military court consisting of Pakistan Army officers. The judges on the FGCM aren't required to possess law degrees.HOW IT HAPPENED WITH KULBHUSHAN JADHAVPakistan Army General Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence to Kulbhushan Jadhav after the Field General Court Martial found him guilty of ""all the charges"".An ISPR release said, ""The spy was tried through Field General Court Martial under the Pakistan Army Act and awarded the death sentence. Today Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed his death sentence awarded by FGCM.""The military court was not closed to outsiders. Kulbhushan Jadhav was not given consular access as demanded by Indian authorities.Pakistan maintained that providing a defending officer during his trial at the Field General Court Martial as per legal provisions of the military court of Pakistan was enough defence for Kulbhushan Jadhav.OPTIONS BEFORE KULBHUSHAN JADHAVThe military courts of Pakistan have unbridled rights and unmatched jurisdiction. They have the right to try civilians for several crimes. The government can also transfer cases to the military courts of Pakistan.The Pakistan government gave an extension to the military courts of Pakistan after the December 2015 terror attack on a Peshawar school.Interestingly, the military courts of Pakistan do not have trained judges or judges with any kind of mandatory legal training.According to existing laws in Pakistan, the military court convicts cannot appeal in a civilian court. This means the possibility of a fair trial is not available for Kulbhushan Jadhav.But, there are two options available to Kulbhushan Jadhav:- According to the Pakistan Army Act 1952, Kulbhushan Jadhav can appeal in the Military Appellate Tribunal. However, the chances of getting a different verdict are slim.- The second option available to Kulbhushan Jadhav is to appeal in a civilian court for 'review' of the FGCM judgment. According to the Pakistan Army Act Section 7.2.3, military court convicts can have the decisions 'reviewed' by civilian courts, where Kulbhushan can have a lawyer of his choice. The government of India can also find a lawyer to defend him if Pakistan gives Kulbhushan Jadhav consular access.HOW MILITARY COURTS OPERATE IN PAKISTANThe human rights activists of Pakistan have questioned the very existence of military courts especially for trial of civilians. According to the International Court of Justice, Pakistan is the only South Asian country to allow trial of civilians by military courts.The principle of fair justice warrants a written judgment by a court of law. The written judgment explains the reasoning and logic behind the verdicts. But, the military courts of Pakistan are not required to give any such document. Even the families of the convicts are not told about the investigation and evidence related to the case.According to a report released by the ISPR about the trial of the cases for 2016, about 90 per cent of the accused confessed to the charges framed by the military courts. Kulbhushan Jadhav's confession was one of them.The unusually high percentage of confession to crimes by the accused in military courts raises serious doubts about the credibility of the statements. This indicates questionable interrogation and torture to elicit favourable confessions. ALSO READ |  Who is Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian sentenced to death in Pakistan?"

The physical component is estimated to cost around Rs 28.73 crore and the biological part would cost around Rs 13.29 crore.?In addition to this, there would be expenditure for the monitoring by a team of experts for 10 years and the cost of transportation of material outside the floodplain,? said an expert.The 47-page report estimates that approximately 120 hectares (about 300 acres) of floodplains of west (right bank) of the river Yamuna and about 50 hectares (120 acres) floodplains of the eastern side (left bank) of the river have been adversely impacted ecologically at different magnitudes.The Art of Living spokesperson, however, has alleged ?bias beyond doubt.??The Expert Committee members of the NGT who were supposed to be non-interested parties to the case and were to act as the eyes and ears of judges have given biased interviews in public while the case is sub-judice...

The three-day World Cultural Festival soon grabbed headlines for allegedly polluting and damaging the Yamuna floodplain ecosystem.The NGT slapped an interim fine Rs 5 crore on the Foundation for environmental damage while efforts were made to ascertain the exact costs of the damage.An initial four-member committee had recommended that the Foundation pay Rs100 to Rs 120 crores as compensation for the restoration work.The green court had later asked an expert panel of seven members to estimate the damage to the floodplains and how much it would cost to fix these damages. This committee observed that the festival had ?completely destroyed, not simply damaged? the riverfront area between DND flyover and the Barapulla drain, which had served as the main event site.?The ground is now totally levelled, compacted and hardened and is totally devoid of water bodies or depressions and almost completely devoid of any vegetation.?Huge amount of earth and debris have been dumped to construct the ramps for access from the DND flyover and from the two pontoon bridges across the Barapulla drain,? the report said.It said the floodplain was severely harmed and ?almost all its natural vegetation? was lost, affecting the natural habitat of a large number animals, insects and other organisms."

However, the Home Ministry informed the upper house that the Narendra Modi government is not considering any such proposal. HI-TECH PLANS TO BOOST SECURITY The government instead has adopted a multi-pronged approach for enhancing security arrangement at the India-Pakistan border. This includes deployment of Border Security Force (BSF), construction of border fence and border roads, installation of floodlights and construction of border outposts (BOPs), introduction of hi-tech surveillance equipment and providing weapons and specialised vehicles to security forces.In another statement, MHA informed Parliament that approximately 250 km of India-Pakistan border has not been covered under fencing primarily due to riverines, ditches and marshy terrain, and in some cases due to pending land acquisition.The MHA said India has sanctioned a pilot project for deployment of technological solutions and force multipliers, physical patrolling, laying of concertina wires, laser infra-red system, among several other measures along the border.

3837,"A former senior executive at online media startup ScoopWhoop has filed FIR against Co-founder Suparn Pandey accusing him of sexual harassment and assault. The complainant accused Pandey of making inappropriate remarks, sending her a lewd video, being uncomfortably close and publicly commenting on her sexuality. She also accused other Co-founders of abetting harassment and trying to conceal it.","After a series of allegations on social media from several women complaining of sexual harassment, Mumbai Police registered an FIR against CEO and founder of The Viral Fever, Arunabh Kumar. He came out and addressed the accusations made against him and said ""I am a heterosexual, single man and when I find a woman sexy, I tell her she's sexy. I compliment women. Is that wrong?"". The comment obviously did not help his case and he faced massive backlash for the same. After the incident, there were various debates and discussions on work place ethics and sexual harassment. Almost 15 days later, another similar incident has come to light. An FIR has been filed against ScoopWhoop co-founder Suparn Pandey accusing him of sexual harassment and sexual assault, as reported by Catch News.  Along with Suparn Pandey, other co-founders have also been named though for abetting harassment and trying to conceal it.A former senior executive of ScoopWhoop Media Pvt. Ltd filed the FIR at the Vasant Kunj (South) police Station, Delhi. The accused has been charged with section 354 A (sexual harassment), section 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman), and section 506 (criminal intimidation), reported Catch News.  The complainant has claimed that during her tenure at ScoopWhoop, which lasted two years, she faced 'inappropriate comments and lewd remarks' the entire time. Pandey even went on to comment on her sexuality. ""Mr. Suparn Pandey in public commented on my sexuality and this comment included calling me a names (sic.) which reflected on my sexual orientation and my sexual preferences (sic.) as well as characterised me in a certain way"", states the FIR according to a Catch News report . Her ordeal was not limited to verbal harassment, the complainant has claimed that Pandey repeatedly got 'uncomfortably close', 'often trying to play with her hair' . He unabashedly even sent her a lewd video on the company's official Gmail chat, the FIR alleges. 'Mr. Pandey got so bold as to send me a lewd video over the official Gmail chat, in which the words were ""aapnu jeans dheeli karo""', reads the FIR. ScoopWhoop's inactionWhen the complainant, took up the matter with ScoopWhoop co-founder Sriparna Tikekar, she assured her that such behaviour would not be repeated. However, apparently she did not take any action against Pandey. The former senior executive did not stop raising the issue with the company's founders even after realising that it had no repercussions for Pandey. She was instead publicly humilated and was allegedly forced to work in close quarters with Pandey. If she was refused, she was ""reprimanded and humiliated"".Suparn Pandey used to show up to work drunk and would try to touch the complainant. She decided to quit after Pandey crossed all limits. 'Mr. Pandey approached me after the meeting, between 8-9:30PM, when I was alone at my work desk and asked me to be less ""aggressive"" in my dealings with other people and learn to ""pour some sugar on it."" That after that, he then got up, kissed my forehead and walked away,' the complainant recounts in the FIR .  She was allegedly dissuaded from lodging a formal complaint and the co-founders threatened to hurt her career and defame her publicly. Following a series of complaints and threats, she resigned from ScoopWhoop. "

""So, what will happen is they (Indian IT firms) will offshore more work and increase their competitiveness. They will do only ten per cent work onsite, and 90 per cent offshore,"" Pai told PTI. ""It can be done very easily for 70-80 per cent of the business. It will improve their competitiveness and make them better,"" he said. ""The new H1-B regulations are very good for Indian IT, and bad for companies which try to use it for cheap labour.

The new regulations would play to the strength Indian IT companies because they have been reducing the number of H1-B visas they collected since 2014, he said. ""So, they are already getting prepared.

The move by Jio comes within a week of the telecom regulator asking the Mukesh Ambani telecom company to withdraw its contentious three-month complimentary offer of unlimited data usage and free calls on payment of a minimum Rs 303.  TRAI, on April 6, had asked Jio to stop the complimentary service offer saying it was not in accordance with the regulatory framework. TRAI had said that Jio will be required to roll back the 3-month complimentary offer in ""shortest possible time"" but clarified that customers who had already subscribed to the said scheme could avail the benefits till June-end. Earlier this week, telecom operator Vodafone approached TRAI alleging that Jio was inviting last minute subscriptions to its Summer Surprise offer despite the regulator finding it in violation of norms.

Bansal said these partnerships bring in a lot more than funds and set the company to compete more aggressively through innovations, which will enable them to collaborate deeply with eBay on cross-border trade and ensure their customers have a wider selection of international products to choose from.

An official added, ""his behaviour of not daring to smoke conforms with extreme religious thought... As a party chief, he should lead the fight against extreme religious thought.""","leaders From K J M Varma Beijing, Apr 11 (PTI) In an unusual move, China has demoted a ruling Communist party official in the volatile Uygur Muslim majority Xinjiang province for not ""daring"" to smoke in front of local religious leaders, regarding it as a sign of timidity in fighting against extremism. Jelil Matniyaz, the party chief of a village in Hotan, Xinjiang was demoted from ""senior staff member"" to ""staff member"" on March 25 for his ""infirm political stands...and for being afraid to smoke in front of religious figures,"" a notice posted on the Hotan Dailys social media WeChat account said. ""Smoking is a personal choice, and religious and ordinary people should respect each other, but his behaviour of not daring to smoke conforms with extreme religious thought in Xinjiang,"" the Global Times quoted a Hotan official as saying. ""As a party chief, he should lead the fight against extreme religious thought, otherwise, he would fail to confront the threat of extreme regional forces,"" the official said. ""According to local religion customs, smoking is not allowed in front of older or religious people,"" Turgunjun Tursun, a professor with the Zhejiang Normal University, said. However, some religious people force ordinary citizens also to comply with the requirements, a senior official who had been working in Xinjiang for years, told the paper. The officials demotion is an isolated case, Tursun said, adding that the local government should balance de-extremist behaviour and local customs in the crackdown on extremism. The move to demote the official comes as authorities intensified their efforts to curb religious extremism. Early this month, the province where the Chinese security forces are battling recurring attacks by Uygur militants enacted a new law banning a wide range of acts, including wearing veils or growing ""abnormal"" beards. In Xinjiang, the Turkic speaking Uygurs are restive for several years over increasing settlements of Han population from other provinces. China blames separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Al-Qaeda affiliated group for the spate of violent attacks in the province. A number of its members reported to have joined the Islamic State militant group to fight in Syria. China believes that they would return to carry out attacks in the country. "

These farmers have been sitting on protest since almost a month, holding skulls in hands and live mice in mouths. ","Farmers from Tamil Nadu ran naked near the Prime Minister's office today, to protest against lack of government assistance in their fight for a drought relief package for a state.The farmers, who have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for 28 days, wanted to drop off their memorandum at the Prime Minister's Office.According to an Indian Express report, a delegation of seven farmers were taken to the PMO and were told that they would meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.When they reached there, they found PM Modi was unavailable.

At one point, the farmers even started rolling on the street naked.The farmer who led the naked protest was eventually arrested. Here's why these farmers are protesting:1. Last year, Tamil Nadu recorded the worst spell of northeast monsoon in 140 years, leading to most farmers losing their winter crop. Most of these farmers had lost their summer crop too, due to Tamil Nadu's tussle with Kanataka over sharing water from the Cauvery river.The timing of government's demonetisation move didn't help either, as the prevailing cash crunch prevented farmers from tackling their farming expenses. Most of them couldn't even prepare for the next sowing season.2. The shock over crop loss and lack of revenue led to some farmers getting heart attacks, while many others committed suicide. At one point, an estimated 106 farmer deaths were reported within a month in Tamil Nadu. Some reports also say 144 farmers committed suicide between October to December in 2016.For the remaining farmers, loan installments and dues to moneylenders have now become the greatest problem. Most farmers haven't earned anything to come through on these payments. Farmers who tried selling their land, couldn't even find buyers because it was that dry.3. With no option left, a contingent of these farmers from Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli came to Delhi and have been protesting at Jantar Mantar since March 14.These farmers seek a drought relief fund of Rs 40,000 crore, better support for their produce and a loan waiver for peasants in Tamil Nadu. One Tamil Nadu local told Firstpost that the farmers asked for a compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre, but they were only paid Rs 5,465 per acre.4. Despite the attention their protests have received, the farmers still await a meeting with the government's top officials. To garner attention, these farmers have resorted to all kinds of methods like cutting themselves and holding dead rats and snakes in their mouth.Late in March some farmers even wore skulls of dead Tamil Nadu farmers, symbolising the fate that awaits them if the centre does not help.Two farmers even attempted suicide at Jantar Mantar."

When Prakash Jha was jury head, Ajay Devgn won. No one questioned them."" This comes after numerous social media users attributed Akshay's win to his friendly equation with Priyadarshan.","Priyadarshan, the chairperson of the feature film section for the National Film Awards, said he does not understand why people are questioning Akshay Kumar's Best Actor award. The filmmaker has collaborated with Akshay Kumar in films like Hera Pheri, Garam Masala, Bhagam Bhaag, Bhool Bhulaiya, De Dana Dan and Khatta Meetha. Many in social media are attributing Akshay's win to his close proximity to Priyadarshan. But the director says last year Ramesh Sippy was head of the jury and none questioned his good friend Amitabh Bachchan's Best Actor win, so why should he and Akshay be subjected to such allegations. ""I have heard of all that and I will answer it in a simple way. When Ramesh Sippy was jury head Amitabh Bachchan won. When Prakash Jha was head of jury, Ajay Devgan won. None questioned at that time. So why all these questions are cropping up today,"" Priyadarshan told PTI. The filmmaker also clarified that Akshay's performance in Rustom and Airlift were considered by the jury during the selection process. However, as only the name of one film could be mentioned, the list featured the courtroom drama Rustom, he said. ""Akshay was given the best actor on the basis of his performance in two films -- Airlift and Rustom. It was the jury's decision. One performance was dramatic and one was realistic. But according to the rule book, only one film can be mentioned and Rustom was mentioned in the list. But the award recognises his performance in both the movies,""said Priyadarshan.This year saw the dominance of regional cinema at the National Film Awards with Marathi film Kasaav winning best feature film, Surabhi CM getting best actress and Rajesh Mapuskar being named best director for Marathi movie Ventilator. Bollywood films which managed to score are Pink (Best Film on Social Issues), Dhanak (Best Children's Film) and Neerja (Best Hindi Film). Priyadarshan says regional films don't chase after box office numbers and that is why they are true to their stories and also give social messages. ""While watching films we realised that a lot of Bollywood movies were themed around homosexuality. The movies are not really highlighting social problems. Whereas regional cinema are themed around fantastic social issues. They try to tell different stories. Even Dangal doesn't talk about social issues. It was a life story,"" said Priyadarshan. ""Regional movies are not made with the aim to earn Rs 100 crore. They are made from the heart. We should promote films that reflect the Indian culture.

3897,"Accusing technology major Google of underpaying women, the US Department of Labor said that ""discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme"". The government department also alleged that Google violated employment laws in relation to salaries for its female employees. Earlier this month, Google had claimed to have closed the gender pay gap globally.","Google has discriminated against its female employees, according to the US Department of Labor (DoL), which said it had evidence of ?systemic compensation disparities?.As part of an ongoing DoL investigation, the government has collected information that suggests the internet search giant is violating federal employment laws with its salaries for women, agency officials said. ?We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,? Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified in court in San Francisco on Friday.Reached for comment Friday afternoon, Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the DoL, said: ?The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.?Herold added: ?The government?s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.?Google strongly denied the accusations of inequities, claiming it did not have a gender pay gap.The explosive allegation against one of the largest and most powerful companies in Silicon Valley comes at a time when the male-dominated tech industry is facing increased scrutiny over gender discrimination, pay disparities and sexual harassment. The allegations emerged at a hearing in federal court as part of a lawsuit the DoL filed against Google in January, seeking to compel the company to provide salary data and documents to the government.Google is a federal contractor, which means it is required to allow the DoL to inspect and copy records and information about its its compliance with equal opportunity laws. Last year, the department?s office of federal contract compliance programs requested job and salary history for Google employees, along with names and contact information, as part of the compliance review.Google, however, repeatedly refused to hand over the data, which was a violation of its contractual obligations with the federal government, according to the DoL?s lawsuit. After the suit was originally filed, a company spokesperson claimed that Google had provided ?hundreds of thousands of records? to the government and that the requests outlined in the complaint were ?overbroad?, revealed confidential information, or violated employees? privacy. Labor officials detailed the government?s discrimination claims against Google at the Friday hearing while making the case for why the company should be forced to comply with the DoL?s requests for documents. Wipper said the department found pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and said officials needed earlier compensation data to evaluate the root of the problem and needed to be able to confidentially interview employees. ?We want to understand what?s causing the disparity,? she said. Lisa Barnett Sween, one of Google?s attorneys, testified in opening remarks that the DoL?s request constituted a ?fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review?. She said the request was an unconstitutional violation of the company?s fourth amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches.Marc Pilotin, a DoL attorney, said: ?For some reason or another, Google wants to hide the pay-related information.?In a statement to the Guardian, Google said: ?We vehemently disagree with [Wipper?s] claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn?t provided any data, or shared its methodology.?The company has recently claimed that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and provides equal pay across races in the US. Herold told the Guardian that the department ?seeks additional information to ensure the accuracy of the department?s findings, because if the findings are confirmed, this is a troubling situation?.Google is not the first tech company to face legal action from the labor department over employment practices. In September, the DoL filed a lawsuit against Palantir, the Palo Alto data analytics company, alleging it systematically discriminated against Asian job applicants in its hiring process. Palantir has argued that the DoL?s analysis was flawed and the company has denied the accusations.In January, the department sued Oracle, another large tech company, claiming it paid white men more than others, leading to pay discrimination against women and black and Asian employees. Oracle claimed the case was ?politically motivated? and said its employment decisions were based on merit and experience.In recent months, there has been uncertainty about the future of these kinds of aggressive DoL enforcement efforts under Donald Trump. The president has rolled back Obama-era protections for female workers, and some DoL staffers have raised concerns that the new administration will not embrace the agency?s core mission of supporting workers? rights. An Oracle executive also joined Trump?s transition team, and the president?s close adviser Peter Thiel co-founded Palantir. In the Google case, the labor department?s lawyers have asked the court to cancel all of the company?s federal contracts and block any future business with the government if it continues to refuse to comply with the audit.Google began releasing diversity statistics in 2014 and reported last year that women made up 31% of its overall workforce and that only 2% of workers were black and 3% Latino. White employees accounted for 59% of the US workforce and Asians made up 32%.Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"

There has been a lot of negative comment so far, comparing Trump?s move to previous US incursions in the Middle East, but little concrete information about the potential consequences, as people wait for a signal from the Kremlin on how Russia is going to play this.The Pentagon has said there were ?multiple conversations? with Russia before the strike, and that ?extraordinary precautions? were taken not to target Russians at the base, but we are also yet to hear anything from either the Kremlin or military HQ on how these discussions looked from Moscow.A report on the state news said the US had launched the attack after ?baseless? claims that Assad had used chemical weapons. Senator Viktor Ozerov said Trump was ?following in the footsteps of Bush Jr who looked for chemical weapons in Iraq, and we all know how that worked out?.Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator and former top foreign policy official, wrote on Twitter shortly before the US missiles were launched:In the 21st century, every US president has had a war in the Middle East, if not two. If Trump goes into Syria, he?ll sit alongside Bush and Obama.Vladimir Safronkov, Russia?s deputy UN ambassador, said:The authors of these plans should stop and think what military operations in Iraq, Libya, and other countries led to.

In a specially-convened press conference in Sydney on Friday, Turnbull said:It sends a strong message to the Assad regime.The retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift. We support the United States in that swift action.Turnbull said it was important to note that the international community was not at war with the Assad regime, and the US had made it clear it was not seeking to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.However, he said events of this week raised ?very real questions? over whether Assad could remain as leader of Syria:This chemical attack was a horrific crime, shocking, even in the context of that brutal war.Turnbull said the US had not asked for more military support, but he left open the possibility of providing it in the future:There is no question that this shocking conflict in Syria is crying out itself for a resolution and we certainly will continue to work with our allies and our partners to see a resolution to this shocking war.

Elle HuntA mainstay of US warfare for more than 20 years, the Tomahawk cruise missile had been considered the most likely weapon for any strike by the Trump administration against the Syrian military. And so it proved.The US launched its surprise attack on an inland airbase near Homs early on Thursday morning, with 59 of the missiles deployed from two naval destroyers. USS Ross and USS Porter were in the eastern Mediterranean sea off Syria?s western coast.More than 6.25m long (20ft) and weighing 1,590kg (3,500lb), the Tomahawk land-attack missile is billed by the US navy as ?an all-weather, long range, subsonic cruise missile? able to be launched from either ships or submarines.They commonly carry warheads of up to 454kg (1,000lb), and are designed to fly at low altitudes towards even heavily defended land targets with extreme accuracy.Their chief advantage in warfare is that they are unmanned, guided by GPS to targets more than 1,600km (1,000 miles) away at high subsonic speeds of 885km/h (550mph).

Boeing said it made the investments in the startup through the ventures arm of a new group called Boeing HorizonX, an innovation cell focused on accelerating potentially transformative aerospace technologies, manufacturing innovations and emerging business models. Boeing HorizonX is partnering with JetBlue Technology Ventures to invest in Zunum Aero. ""At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted, and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,"" it said in a statement. ""As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilised airports and reinvent regional travel,"" JetBlue said. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX vice president Steve Nordlund said Zunums hybrid electric technology was leading the way in the up-and-coming segment, according to the Business Insider report. "
3921,"The Keibul Lamjao National Park, located in the Loktak Lake in Manipur, India, is known as the only floating national park in the world. The area is characterised by 'phumdis', a Manipuri word referring to floating mats of soil and vegetation. Among numerous animal species, the park is home to the brow-antlered deer, which is locally known as the 'Sangai'.","A proposition to travel to the North East is always exciting, and Manipur is a place that provides a gateway to this picturesque part of the country. Most of us have heard about the iconic Loktak Lake, located in Bishnupur district, at a distance of 53km from Imphal. More so, because it is considered to be the largest freshwater lake in the eastern part of India. It is known among travellers and photographers due to the round-shaped floating swamps, called Phumdis in the local language.But that's not all that this lake has. Very few travellers are aware of Keibul Lamjao, which is the only floating national park in the world. Accessible only by the dugout canoes, this green beauty is perched in the middle of the Loktak Lake. This forest is home to the sangai, or the brow-antlered deer, which is one of the most endangered species of deer in the world. The sangai is the state animal of Manipur and is an important part of the sociocultural life of the people. There is even an annual festival of dance and music that is named after this rare animal. According to a census done in April 2014, the total number of sangais in Keibul stood at 204. If media reports are to be believed, the number fell in 2015, but it's not confirmed as the forest officials didn't have enough funds to carry out a head count that year.

Doctors treating her at a private hospital said on Thursday evening that she was stable and managed to speak though a blood clot was detected in her brain.Her uncle, HC Bhatia, told HT that she had received multiple injuries to her brain nerves.Kalra gained consciousness briefly on Wednesday night to tell police she was attacked, but fell unconscious soon after.Police said they registered a case of attempt to murder and that the attack was possibly carried out with iron rods but were clueless about possible suspects. ?We have no eyewitnesses of this attack. We were informed about a woman lying unconscious in the park by a visitor. But the caller had not witnessed the attack,? said Milind Dumbre, deputy commissioner of police (north-west). Kalra lives with her family in Delhi.The park where she was attacked is a popular destination for morning and evening walkers. Kalra?s family said there were many people in the area at the time, but that no one had come forward as eyewitness. According to the police, at least four fatal attacks have been reported from public parks in north and northwest Delhi in the last two years.Her family said like most evenings, she left for a walk in Picnic Hut --a park adjacent to her home -- around 6.15pm on Wednesday. ?At 7.30pm, Kalra?s sister received a call from police that she was admitted to Deep Chand Hospital with brain injuries,? said Bhatia.Kalra was taken to Fortis Shalimar Bagh late at night with frontal-lobe fractures in her skull. ?She was brought in by her sister, who had earlier taken her to Deep Chand Hospital, which referred her to Fortis. She had a lot of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) collection in her brain cavities, and underwent an emergency surgery to remove it at late night,? said a doctor treating her at Fortis. The condition, called hydrocephalus, can kill if the fluid is not removed. On Thursday, she had to undergo a repeat CT (computed tomography) scan to check if fluid collection had stopped in her brain.The family is unsure about the motive of the attack. ?She is a brave woman, but we are not aware of her enmity with anyone,? said Bhatia.The family initially suspected Kalra was attacked by people who may have tried to snatch her mobile phone. ?But later we checked to find that she had left her phone at home while leaving. She was not carrying any valuables either,? he added."

The flight is believed to have been provided by Shiv Sena MP Rajkumar Dhoot. Previously, SpiceJet, Air India and IndiGo had cancelled Gaikwad's tickets and he had travelled to Delhi by road. ","Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad, who has been banned from flying by several airlines after he assaulted an Air India staffer on March 23, reached Delhi on Wednesday via a chartered flight, according to sources.Shiv Sena is all set to create ruckus in Parliament on Thursday to push for its demand to revoke the flying ban against its MP Ravindra Gaikwad. The chartered flight by which Gaikwad flew in to Delhi is believed to have been provided by another Shiv Sena MP Rajkumar Dhoot. Sources say Gaikwad will be reaching Parliament on April 6. Shiv Sena is expected to create ruckus in Parliament against the ban imposed on him.  Sena MPs had approached Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju seeking his intervention into the matter, but they failed to get any assurance from him. SHIV SENA THREATENS TO CREATE RUCKUSShiv Sena MP Anand Adsul, while speaking in the Zero Hour on Wednesday, said that no one was listening to his party. ""Just because we are in the government does not imply we cannot create ruckus"", he threatened.   Adsul will move an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on April 6 on the issue of blacklisting of Gaikwad by airlines and the government's alleged failure to take action against them. If sources are to be believed, Shiv Sena is going to raise this issue prominently once Gaikwad reaches Parliament. Despite trying hard to get the government to lift the travel ban, Sena has not found any success yet. It seems the BJP is, rightly so, avoiding backing the Shiv Sena on an issue that has evoked so much nationwide outrage.Gaikwad, who hails from Osmanabad in Maharashtra, had allegedly hit an Air India staffer 25 times with a slipper on board a Pune-Delhi flight. This prompted Air India to ban him and other airlines followed suit with the result that he had to travel back to Maharashtra by August Kranti Rajdhani Express after he couldn't book an air ticket on any carrier.GAIKWAD FAKED HIS NAME TO GET FLIGHT TICKETThe aggrieved Air India staffer also lodged two FIRs against Gaikwad in Delhi, investigation into which is still on. Gaikwad tried to fly 4 times even under false identities, but his ticket could not be processed. Facing scathing criticism over the incident, the Shiv Sena had earlier assured that it would reprimand Gaikwad, but that never happened. In fact, the party began defending his action soon after. Senior leaders of the party think that they are being cornered by the BJP on this issue as they have found no support from anywhere. This has prompted the Sena to resort to an aggressive and unruly show of strength, and Parliament is likely to witness uproarious scenes over the issue on Thursday.Also read | Slippergate: Shiv Sena to protest in Parliament if MP Ravindra Gaikwad's flying ban is not liftedAlso read | Grounded MP Gaikwad tweaked name 4 times to book Air India tickets"

3926,"US-based researchers tested a cluster of trees, soil and woody debris to determine whether those three components were sources or sinks of greenhouse gases. Tree trunks were found to emit methane rather than storing it, scientists said, which could counteract absorption of methane by forest soils. However, the mechanism of methane production in forests was not clearly understood.","Washington, Apr 3 (PTI) Tree trunks in upland forests actually emit methane rather than storing it, say scientists who claim to have found a new, previously unaccounted source of this powerful greenhouse gas. Researchers from University of Delaware (UD) in the US found that upland forest soils usually take up and store methane, but this effect can be counteracted by methane emissions from tree trunks. They tested a cluster of trees, soil and coarse woody debris (CWD) - dead wood lying on the forest floor in various stages of decomposition - to measure fluxes of methane and carbon dioxide. The team used a state-of-the-art greenhouse gas analyser based on laser absorption technology, called Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS). They visited the site over the course of one growing season - April to December. Researchers measured the carbon dioxide and methane fluxes of the soil, tree trunks and CWD to determine whether those three components were sources or sinks of these greenhouse gases. ""We believe our work can help fill in some gaps in methane budgets and environmental processes in global ecosystem models,"" said Rodrigo Vargas assistant professor in UD. ""What we have found in this study is that some coarse woody debris act kind of like the soil and consume methane while other pieces of coarse woody debris emit small amounts of methane, which is also what we saw with living tree trunks,"" said Daniel Warner of UD. ""The tree trunks constantly have low but detectable emissions of methane,"" said Vargas. ""Soils are providing an environmental service of sequestering this potent greenhouse gas, but the trunks are releasing methane equivalent to 4 per cent of what could be captured by CWD and soils at the ecosystem scale,"" he said.

3939,"A prematurely-born girl child, who was declared dead by a male nurse at a hospital in Rajasthan, 'came back to life' on Tuesday at a crematorium where her body was taken for last rites. The on-duty nurse had declared the newborn dead when he noticed that she was neither crying nor breathing, but she suddenly started crying at the crematorium.","In Rajasthan's Bundi district, a shocking incident shed some light on the sad state of affairs of the health department. A woman had to give birth in the absence of a doctor in a government hospital in Bundi, and the male nurse who assisted her during the delivery told her that her child was dead and should be taken to the burial ground. All this happened in the absence of a doctor. Following the male nurse's advice, the family took the new born for the burial. But few minutes before the burial the child started crying and that's when everyone realised that the baby girl is still alive. They again went to the hospital and complained against the male nurse who misguided them. When the deputy superintendent saw a ruckus, he went on to defend the nurse and said that since the child is born weak, there are hardly any chances of survival. He in fact did not even try saving the newborn's life.Residents of Bundi district are appalled by this incident of negligence and questioned the hospital authorities that if the infant had not cried before the burial then because of the wrong information given to them, the family would have buried her alive. Not only that, deliveries being done in the absence of doctors raises many questions about the functioning of the hospital. Deputy controller Dr OP Verma defended his staff and said that the baby girl was born premature and since there was no movement at the time of birth, she was declared dead. However, the family members believe that if immediately after delivery the infant would have been shifted to the ICU then her health would not have deteriorated."

The state will spend around ?36,000 crore to fund the loan waiver which will benefit around 86 lakh farmers. Loan waiver for farmers was one of the biggest poll promises of the Bharatiya Janata Party.","Delivering on the Bharatiya Janata Party's poll promise, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today waived off farmers' loan of upto Rs 1 lakh. The decision taken in the first meeting of Adityanath Cabinet will add a burden of Rs 30,729 crore on the state exchequer and benefit nearly 2.15 crore farmers. Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off. The BJP, which won a massive majority bagging 312 seats in the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh Assembly, in its Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra (manifesto), had promised to waive the loans of small and marginal farmers.Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had said during campaigning that writing off farm loans would be among the foremost tasks of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.Although there is no Constitutional compulsion of convening the first cabinet meeting within a certain period, traditionally the ruling party has held it within a week or so of forming the government.The Adityanath government was sworn-in on March 19.Government sources said around 2.30 crore farmers in the state suffered losses due to natural calamities in the recent past and were unable to repay loans amounting to about Rs 62,000 crore.They also said that it could be difficult to handle the burden of loan waiver in a single financial year and that was one of the reasons to put the cabinet meeting on hold till a way was found to honour the prime minister's poll promise.With inputs from Balkrishna ALSO READ:  Yogi Adityanath's first interview after taking charge of UP, says Ayodhya issue should be resolved through talksYogi Adityanath gives Uttar Pradesh's bureaucracy the jitters"

He said that the SP lost despite so many good deeds it did in Uttar Pradesh and the primary reason for that was the internal clash in the party where people were backstabbing each other to gain prominence.He said that he felt bad, but there was nobody he could turn to in order to express his pain, so he remained silent and got humiliated.

The defeat in Assembly elections was a result of that.

Alleging that Infosys board was ""misguided"", Pai said the """"fundamental problem"" was the pay hike given earlier to CEO Vishal Sikka ""without any justification"", because of which other executives were also expecting higher pay. He said salary levels in India cannot be compared with that in the US. ""I totally agree with Murthy that it was not proper. We should have Indian norm for compensation; we cant follow American norm, we (Infosys) are not an American company,"" Pai, who was also formerly Chief Finance Officer of Infosys, told PTI in a telephonic interview. The comments come at a time when a row has erupted again between some founders and the current management of the firm. Pai argued that at a time when the salary for entry level software engineers had not been raised in the IT industry in India for the past seven years, it is totally wrong to hike the compensation for top-level executives. ""The starting salary for software engineers has not gone up for the past seven years; and the inflation in the last seven years is about 60 per cent,"" he said. The salary of Chief Operating Officer (of Infosys) three-four years ago was Rs 3.5 crore or Rs 4 crore. Now, it has gone up to Rs 12 crore, according to the Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services and Aarin Capital. ""I think unless people at the bottom (software engineers) get good, regular hike, paying people at the top for doing nothing...for long period of time is totally wrong,"" Pai said. Without naming Rao, he said, ""That too we have been paying (compensation hike) for a person who has been in the company for 30 years."" ""If somebody has done spectacularly well, then its okay. Performance is not spectacular. Salary is spectacular,"" he said. ""I think the Board was misguided. You hired a CEO (Vishal Sikka). You are forced by the CEO to increase (his) salary from USD 7 million to 11 million. There was no justification,"" he said. ""When you see CEO getting so much, then COO will say: what about me? I cannot be paid one-tenth of what CEO is being paid,"" he said. ""The fundamental error was increasing CEOs salary from USD 7 million to 11 million without any justification,"" Pai further said. Raising the CEOs salary was the ""fundamental problem,"" and it could now lead to top-level executives and executive committee members seeking a pay hike, he said. "

Although the print and paper quality of the seized counterfeits was poor, they resembled genuine notes.The officials said the change of security features of currency notes in every 3-4 years will lead to curbing of counterfeiting to a great extent.Those who were arrested recently along with fake notes with face value of Rs 2,000 have told investigators that the notes were printed in Pakistan with the help of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and had been smuggled into the country through Bangladesh, the officials claimed.A study conducted by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, in 2016 pegged the value of fake Indian currency notes in circulation at Rs 400 crore."

India will be no exception to this global trend of having a few dominating players, he added. When asked about the names of banks which will dominate the domestic banking space, Kotak declined to specify the names but said State Bank of India will be one among them. ""The rest who knows? Cant say anything about ourselves but each of us will have to do our bit to get ourselves onto the high table. You just cant take it for granted,"" he said.

He said the share of private sector lenders should eventually grow beyond the present 25 per cent or thereabout. ""Competition may be from government banks, new players. You have to be alert, agile and paranoid,"" he said. Kotak also made a strong pitch for having norms on ""bank mortality"", underlining that not all the players who enter due to liberal rules cant make it commercially, and should thus be given exit options. ""That is a big issue. Who is thinking about mortality in banking? We have to see in the long-term how it happens. As you make entry easier, mortality always have to be thought about,"" Kotak said. When asked about if e-wallets will succeed, Kotak said, ""to some of those models, you need to ask the question- how will you get stickiness and ultimately monetise?"" Advocating a faster push on growth, Kotak said he is getting the vibes of an uptick in growth. ""Macroeconomic stability, now combined with political stability, is a very big plus for the country to embark faster on the growth side. This is our opportunity,"" he said. When pointed to the continuing reluctance of private sector to invest since the past three years now, Kotak said, ""we need to be bold and get the animal spirits back.

The contest was marred by one controversy after another with the two captains -- Kohli and Steve Smith -- continuously being in the eye of a storm.Kohli was in sublime form before this series, becoming the only man to slam double hundreds in four consecutive series. The 28-year-old amassed 1457 runs in 13 matches this season. But he had a horrendous outing with the bat in the series against Tests against Australia, totalling just 46 runs in five innings with scores of 0, 13, 12, 15 and 6 in three games. He had to sit out of the fourth and final Test because of a shoulder injury. Ganguly, regarded as one of India's most successful captains, rated Kohli as among of the finest in the world while describing him as a passionate skipper.""There are two Virats for me. The batsman and the captain. (Kohli has ensured India will never back down: Clarke to India Today)""The batsman surely is one of the best in the world because he has set high standards for himself, both in terms of fitness and the hunger to score big. The captain is more passionate and more of a leader than anything else,"" Ganguly wrote.""He wants to win and win every day and while it may not be possible always, I see Virat not settling for anything that isn't No.1.""GANGULY PRAISES PUJARAThe former India skipper also shared his delight at watching KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav gain in confidence and match Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin. He tipped Cheteshwar Pujara as the batsman who will be most critical to India's successes abroad.""More than the results, I enjoyed the journey, watching how players like KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav gained in confidence and matched the two champions, Virat and Ravichandran Ashwin,"" Ganguly wrote.  (Sachin Tendulkar calls Cheteshwar Pujara 'silent warrior')""But the one who stood out was Cheteshwar Pujara. I remember when he was dropped for a Test in West Indies last year, I had said Pujara was a special batsman and shouldn't have been dropped. A small matter of 1,316 runs have come from his bat this season and Pujara will be the most critical for Virat when India start travelling outside of the sub-continent.""'POTENTIAL TO WIN ANYWHERE'Ganguly said the current Indian team has the potential to win anywhere in the world.""And having watched the last 13 home Tests, I hope Virat and his team really has the potential to win anywhere - in or outside India,"" he said.Talking about the Dharamsala Test, which according to him was the highlight of the season, Ganguly wrote: ""I was sitting at home around lunchtime on Day Three when Australia began its second innings. (Virat Kohli needs to take short break from cricket: Brad Haddin )""Over the next hour or so, I watched such a great piece of fast and hostile bowling by the two Indians, Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The way they got the Australians hopping and succumbing to the pace, I am so pleased for Virat.""The most memorable win came in conditions actually tailor-made for the Australians more than the Indians. The fact that India beat the Aussies at their own game will surely give another twist to Virat's captaincy.""'KUMBLE'S ROLE'Ganguly also said chief coach Anil Kumble played a big role in India's success in the home season.""When the BCCI appointed a three-member panel that had Tendulkar, Laxman and me to help in the process of selecting a coach, Anil's vision was as decisive as his bowling used to be.

It was rated 3/5 (TOI), 2.5/5 (India Today), 2/5 (NDTV).","Naam Shabana, starring Taapsee Pannu in the lead role, is a spin-off of the 2015 hit Baby. Will the big Bollywood release this week match up to the success of Baby? Here is our Naam Shabana movie review.Naam Shabana Cast: Taapsee Pannu, Akshay Kumar, Manoj Bajpayee, Anupam Kher, Prithviraj SukumaranNaam Shabana Director: Shivam NairNaam Shabana Rating:  (2.5/5)The surprise package of Baby, Taapsee Pannu, kicking some serious butt, Akshay Kumar's one-liners and lots of thrills - Naam Shabana looks full of crowd-pleasers on the surface, and if in doubt, there's always Bharat Mata Ki Jai. The problem is that the trailer gave it all away, which, by default, makes the first half of Naam Shabana a drag.Shabana (Taapsee) is a reserved second year B.Com student whose life revolves around Kudo training and her widowed mother. Her classmate Jai (Taher Mithaiwala) is smitten by her, but is only stuck with ferrying her back-and-forth from college, because she does not entertain his declarations of love. When they finally go on a date, she opens up about her dark past and finally reciprocates his feelings. But their yet-to-bloom romance is cut short when, on their way home, they get pursued by eve-teasers and a tragedy follows.From this point, the making of Shabana, the lethal spy, starts. ""Females are born with an extra strain in their DNA. Mardon ko gadgets ki zaroorat padti hai, auratein pre-configured aati hai,"" Manoj Bajpayee's character says when Shabana asks him why the agency chose her out of the crores of people. You don't know whether to laugh.But laughs there are, in the form of Baby nostalgia. Akshay's ""conference"" moment and ""mantriji toh aaj bahut busy hai"" make a comeback in Naam Shabana. There is also a subtle dig at quintessential action sequences where the hero and the villain rip off their shirts and have a fist fight (think Dabangg), which elicits some chuckles.The hunky antagonist Prithviraj Sukumaran is as dangerous as he is handsome. But for reasons best known to the makers, he divulges key information about himself after years of painstakingly (quite literally, as you'll find out) staying under the radar. And it is never quite explained why a rookie like Shabana must take him out, when one of their best, Akshay, just sits and twiddles his thumbs. (Note that the baddie has already eliminated five seasoned agents who went to apprehend him.)It is perhaps to the director Shivam Nair's credit that in spite of the loopholes, Naam Shabana gives us some enjoyable moments. Taapsee is the hero of the film, save in the few scenes with Akshay, when he steals the limelight from her because ""itne door se aaya hoon, kuch toh karne do!"" And although Taapsee shoulders the film, her name appears in the end credits only AFTER Akshay's, in spite of his role being only an extended cameo. Sigh. The two club songs could have been done away with; although they are woven into the plot, they come across as jarring in a film like this. Especially amidst strong comments on counter-terrorism vis-a-vis the socio-political situation. Shabana is told that her Muslim identity is an advantage to the agency because, ""Aaj kal ke jo haalat hai, us mein tumhare religion ki vajah se humara access badhta hai aur raaste khulte hai."" It would have been interesting to explore that in some more depth, but it is never addressed again."

He, however, remained defiant  and, instead, blamed Sukumar for the incident.He told reporters at Maharashtra Sadan on Thursday morning that he has no regrets. ?Kaahe ka pashchaataap (what is there to repent)?

4003,"The stamping of hand baggage will be stopped at Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Cochin airports from April 1. Before this, all hand baggage had to be rubber-stamped by security personnel after it was put through security scanners at airports. Notably, this plan had been implemented earlier but was stopped due to the lack of required security equipment.","Domestic air travellers at Delhi and six other airports will not have to get hand baggage tag stamped anymore.  The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), has decided to do away with the procedure to speed up the check in process from April 1. Besides Delhi, the rule will be implemented in Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Cochin. In December, CISF had started trial runs for this but stamping was resumed after a week due to security concerns. The BCAS had in February issued an order announcing that the procedure was to be done away with but the CISF had at that time object to immediate implementation of the plan. Following this, a joint meeting was held to iron out issues.  ?Appropriate measures have been taken. The cycle of security check will speed up and our staff will get more time to check suspicious baggage,? CISF DG OP Singh said.Recently, CISF had conducted trial runs in two phases at 12 airports and concluded that stamping of baggage tags could be dispensed with after certain modifications of security architecture in Security Hold Areas of the airports and installation of high definition CCTV cameras. These modifications were required to make sure that passengers could not access bags containing restricted items which are segregated by CISF personnel for checking. ?High Definition CCTV cameras focussed on the baggage screening system were required so that CISF personnel who cleared a bag could be easily identified to fix accountability,? a CISF official said.CISF had collected the feed back during the one-week trial run. ?In Bengaluru, 89% of the passengers appreciated the move, while 11% said that stamp on tag brings a sense of security. In Delhi, over 2,400 flights were covered and in some cases, during random check at boarding gates, few suspicious items were caught. We were required to fill the gap before reintroducing it,? the official added.During the trial run from December 15-22, security check areas were monitored through CCTV cameras to ensure no passenger skips the mandatory check. CISF staff at the boarding gates have been asked not to check for  baggage tag. The decision was taken after the D-G met representatives of all the airlines last week. ?As per the feedback, stamping causes inconvenience to passengers. Many a times, a passenger is turned away from the boarding gate if the tag gets misplaced,? he further said.Often if a traveller is asked to open a bag after it goes through a scan. Others in the queue have to wait till their tags can be stamped. ?Now, if one passenger is stopped, others in the queue can move on to the boarding gate after security check. This will benefit the passengers and at no point, security will be compromised,? he said. "

The cinema hall, which is located in Connaught Place, was said to be a favourite of Raj Kapoor. The building will be converted into a multiplex soon.","Raj Kapoor?s Mera Naam Joker and Sangam will be the last two movies to be shown at Delhi?s 85-year-old Regal cinema hall that is closing down on March 30.One of the owners of the hall, Vishal Choudhary, said that he received many requests and fan mails requesting them to screen Raj Kapoor?s movies as the hall was his favourite. He is said to have visited the theatre regularly and hosted premieres of several films released under the banner of RK films, including Sangam that released in 1964 and Mera Naam Joker, first screened in 1970.The hall that is currently playing Anushka Sharma-starrer Phillauri will show Mera Naam Joker  in the evening at six and Sangam at 9pm on Thursday.Regal Cinema in Connaught Place was the first theatre in the area opened in 1932 by Sir Sobha Singh.Called the New Delhi Premier Theatre in its early days, Regal may return as a multiplex with four auditoria. According to the owners, they are trying to get permission from agencies concerned to build a multiplex at the same spot.?The facade will not be changed as the building is a heritage structure but inside there will be major changes including a new design of the hall, better seats, new toilets and canteen,? said Choudhary.The corridors and the staircase of the hall is lined with black and white photographs of actors Dev Anand, Meena Kumari, Nargis, and Raj Kapoor.?Raj Kapoor and Nargis would spend time a lot of time here. Kapoor often sat through the premieres of his films. The theatre was decorated and rituals were performed before the start of every film. Every show then was house full in advance for at least a week,? said Roop Ghai, manager.Choudhary said he has got 60% of the proposal to build a multiplex cleared. ?We have got the no-objection certificate from fire department and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as it is a heritage site. Our designs have been approved by Delhi Urban Arts Commission,? he told Hindustan Times.?It will, however, take at least a year before the work begins as we have to take permission from several other departments and it takes a long time to complete these things,? he said. Hindustan Times had reported on December 22 that the cinema was on the verge of closing due to severe cash crunch aggravated by demonetisation.Choudhary said it was time to fold up Regal as they had not been making money for many years now. ?Business has been down for a decade and last month?s collection of Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya film was also not very good.? He said the cinema hall has been unable to recover operating costs over the past two years. ?Half the money we get from tickets goes to the distributor. It costs us over Rs 2 lakh a week to run a show.?Choudhary also said that they didn?t want to take any chances after the collapse of some buildings in Connaught Place recently. The New Delhi Municipal Council has asked the owners of buildings in the area to prove structural capability. This is another reason why he decided to close the theatre and rebuild it.The first and second floors of the Regal Building were sold to Madame Tussauds in 1996, so the famed wax museum could open its 22nd branch in Delhi. The ground floor remains with the owner."

4021,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a ban on the registration and sale of vehicles compliant with the older Bharat Stage-III (BS-III) emission norms from April 1. The Supreme Court asserted that the health of millions was more important than commercial interests. Notably, more stringent BS-IV norms were introduced in 2010, and a nationwide rollout is expected on April 1.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday banned the sale and registration of Bharat Stage (BS)-III emission norm-compliant vehicles from April 1, saying the health of millions was more important than commercial interests.The decision could deal a Rs 12,000-crore blow to auto manufactures as about 820,000 vehicles, most of them two-wheelers, are lying unsold.India will switch to the more efficient and stringent BS-IV norms, already in place in some parts of the country, including Delhi, from April 1.?The number of such vehicles may be small compared to the overall number of vehicles in the country but the health of the people is far, far more important than the commercial interests of the manufacturers,? a bench of justice Madan B Lokur and justice Deepak Gupta said, rejecting the plea of automobile firms for time to dispose of BS-III vehicles.The court, which has passed several orders to check pollution, said the manufacturers were aware that from April 1 they would be required to manufacture only BS-IV vehicles but they failed to take sufficient pro-active steps.The ruling came on a plea by the environment pollution control authority (Epca), which petitioned the court that only BS-IV vehicles should be sold in the market. Most automobile companies except Bajaj opposed the plea.The objective behind a cleaner fuel technology would not be achieved if older vehicles continue to flood the market, said Epca, a Supreme-court appointed autonomous body that advises government on ecological issues.The court also rejected the Centre?s argument that the BS-IV rollout only banned manufacturing and not the sale of the BS-III vehicles.Setback to car companies. SC restrains them from selling BS-3 vehicles from April 1 @htTweets? bhadra sinha (@BhadraSinha) March 29, 2017The biggest difference between the two is the emission of carbon particulate matter, a major air pollutant. While BS-III vehicles emit 2.30gm of carbon monoxide per kg of fuel, the emission drops to 1gm per kg in BS-IV vehicles.Transition to BS-IV could lead to a substantial drop in particulate matter emissions. For instance, new trucks could see an 80% drop in emissions and cars by 50%, Epca told the court.Similarly, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions ? a big concern for two-wheelers ? could drop between 41 and 80%, depending on the engine size, it said. The norms have to be followed by auto makers as well as fuel companies. The solicitor general told the court that BS-IV fuel would be available across India from April 1.Industry would abide by the order, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) president Vinod K Dasari said. The industry had been ready with BS-IV manufacturing since 2010 but the sale of these vehicles was not possible nationwide due to lack of BS-IV fuel, Dasari said. India has set a deadline of 2020 to switch to BS-VI norms, giving a miss to stage V. But the leap, which will include technology upgrade, will make vehicles pricier ? petrol cars by Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 and diesel ones could cost up to Rs 1 lakh more."

4040,"German water expert Martin Riese works as a water sommelier and is paid to taste water for Patina Restaurant Group in California. Riese, who has been drinking water professionally since 2005, is known to be the only certified 'Water Sommelier' in America. He also organises water tastings and classes to teach people how to identify different kinds of water.","You might think you have a high-paying and relaxing job, but what you do for a living is nothing compared to what Martin Riese does. He tastes different kinds of bottled water, and gets paid s**tloads of money for it!Yes, you read that right. Riese is a German water expert, and believes that water should be treated the same way as wine. What does that mean? Well, if we can go around tasting varieties of wine, measuring and comparing the depth of their flavour, then why can't we do the same thing with bottled water?So, instead of a wine sommelier (a steward or expert trained in wine services), Riese is actually a water sommelier. What makes his taste buds tingle is nothing less than H2O, which might come in differently-shaped bottles, and look clear and pure, but it's actually nothing of the kind.Not many people know that bottled water or mineral water is actually graded according to their TDS level. TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids, or the mineral count in the water we drink. What this essentially means is that there is no bottled water that is pure (though it might look like it). In this day and age, water is treated, has differing mineral counts, and therefore different tastes. A water sommelier is just trained to identify these differences.Also read: Someone deep fried water successfully, just so you could have water pakorasAll you need to be good at this job is an unquenchable thirst for water. Riese is the only one who holds the title of water sommelier in the USA, where he moved from Germany in 2012. Apparently, water sommeliers are quite common in Europe, and all of them advocate water as the most precious drink in the world (now you just can't disagree with that!).Water has body, and depth--we all know this every time we drink some of it. But if the water sommeliers like Riese are to be believed, it has a lot to do with smell and sight as well as taste. Given the rising water crises we face globally, and our increasing dependence on packaged water, developing this sort of a flavour profile might just be the way to go for the future. And experts like Riese are actually doing their part in this venture."

The Swiss agency is mandated to defend the interests of Switzerland on international financial and tax matters and participates in international negotiations. It said in its latest quarterly newsletter that necessary steps will be in place to ensure the exchanged data do not fall into the wrong hands or get misused. ""Switzerland is prepared in principle to introduce the automatic exchange of information with all states and territories which meet the relevant requirements. In this sense, the confidentiality and security of the data are important elements of this international standard,"" it said. ""Switzerland implements the automatic reciprocal exchange of information only with countries which can guarantee confidentiality and data protection. Before any exchanges occur, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes carries out a thorough examination as to whether or not the partner states which have undertaken to introduce the automatic exchange of information comply with the requirements."" ""In some important cases, Switzerland additionally gets an on-the-spot impression of the situation in the partner states. Given that Switzerland does not belong to the group of countries which implemented the standard early on (so-called early adopters), it is also benefiting from the experience of other countries,"" the SIF said. ""Before the first exchange occurs, it will be able to examine if all significant elements of the standard have been met. Should it subsequently transpire that a country has not fulfilled its obligations, Switzerland can at any time suspend the automatic exchange of information with the country concerned,"" it added.SYSTEM IN PLACE 'RELATIVELY SIMPLE' The Swiss agency further said the system in place so far has been ""relatively simple"", wherein whenever a foreign tax authority was interested in obtaining information located in Switzerland, it had to make a request for administrative assistance. ""However, the rapid international developments in recent years have provided Switzerland with two new forms of exchange of information in the area of taxes: spontaneous and automatic exchange of information (AEOI),"" it added. In the case of the AEOI, countries mutually exchange information automatically on financial accounts and the details in this case are determined as the standards drawn up by the OECD. The information in spontaneous exchange needs to be exchanged if the transmitting country suspects that the information available might be of interest to another country. While spontaneous exchange has nothing to do with voluntary in this context -- it only means that no preliminary request has been submitted -- this framework was being handled very differently from country to country up to now, the SIF said. ""Within the scope of the OECD and G20 project to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), the spontaneous exchange of information was specified for the first time in the area of advance tax rulings, where there is a risk of base erosion or profit shifting."" ""The Federal Council adopted the current international standard in this area in the context of a revision of the Tax Administrative Assistance Ordinance. Switzerland will spontaneously exchange information on advance tax rulings for the first time next year,"" it added. 'NUMBER OF DOMESTIC SWISS BANK BRANCHES HAS HALVED' The agency further said that over the past 30 years, the number of domestic bank branches in Switzerland has almost halved. ""A reduction in the number of banking institutions and their branches can be the result of mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies. A number of policy measures have been put in place by Swiss authorities in recent years to address concerns of its banks providing high secrecy walls around their global clients. New rules make it much easier for several foreign jurisdictions, including India, to get details from Switzerland about people suspected to be involved in tax evasion and other financial crimes. Switzerland has also been issuing notices to several resident Indians and even Indians settled abroad after the receipt of request from India for ""administrative assistance"", including information about their Swiss bank account details. As per the local law, Switzerland gives an opportunity to the entity concerned to challenge the sharing of information, before providing the assistance to the requesting nation. While India and Switzerland late last year signed a new pact for automatic exchange of information about account details 2018 onwards, the pending requests have been made under their existing bilateral tax treaty. The pace of seeking such details seems to have quickened in recent months, going by the sudden spurt in the number of Indian names figuring in such notifications.

4055,"Telecom giant BT has been fined $53 million (?345 crore) for a ""serious breach"" of rules, making it the largest fine imposed on a telco. BT will also have to pay $376 million (?2,440 crore) in compensation to rivals. BT allegedly misused its contracts to cut compensation payments for delays in connecting high-speed business lines to other telcos including Vodafone.","BT has been fined  42m, the largest penalty imposed by regulator Ofcom, and will have to pay an estimated  300m in compensation to rival telecoms companies over delays installing high-speed internet connections.Ofcom found that BT broke rules put in place to stop Openreach, its subsidiary that controls the UK broadband infrastructure network, abusing its ?significant market power? by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case.BT said it expected to pay out  300m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk for the ?serious breach? of Ofcom?s rules.?The size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses,? said Gaucho Rasmussen, investigations director at Ofcom. ?Our message is clear ? we will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. Millions of people rely on BT?s network for the phone and broadband services they use every day.?Compensation must be paid to affected providers within 12 months, Ofcom said.The record  42m penalty, which was reduced from  60m after BT admitted full liability and agreed to pay back rivals, is more than 11 times greater than the previous largest fine levied on a telecoms operator by Ofcom. Last year, Vodafone was fined  3.7m for taking pay-as-you-go customers? money without providing a service. BT?s fine is more than seven times that of the second largest penalty handed down, the  5.7m ITV had to pay in 2008 over the ?abuse? of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows.Ofcom?s investigation into BT focused on the installation of high-speed business lines, known as ethernet services, which provide connections for big businesses as well as organisations including schools, hospitals and libraries, between January 2013 and December 2014. It was instigated after a complaint from Vodafone, which relies on BT ethernet services to transmit data between its mobile masts. Vodafone accused Openreach of failing to meet its 30-day installation guarantee but then reclassifying the delay as having been agreed by rivals which allowed it to avoid paying compensation.?These high-speed lines are a vital part of this country?s digital backbone,? said Rasmussen. ?We found BT broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time.?BT was also fined  300,000 for ?failing to provide information to Ofcom?.?We apologise wholeheartedly for the mistakes Openreach made in the past when processing orders for a number of high-speed business connections,? said Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach. ?This shouldn?t have happened and we fully accept Ofcom?s findings.? A spokesman for Vodafone said: ?We hope this ruling will encourage BT Openreach to finally drop the unacceptable practices it has used to avoid paying compensation for late delivery of fixed fibre lines, which have impacted businesses across the country as well as our own 4G roll-out.?Less than half (48.8%) of high speed ethernet installations were completed within 30 days, according to Openreach?s own statistics for the final quarter of last year.However, Openreach said that almost 87% of installations are completed by the original agreed date, and that the number of outstanding orders is at a 34-month low.Rivals have repeatedly called for Openreach, responsible for building and maintaining the tens of millions of copper and fibre lines that run from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses across the UK, to be split from BT.They argue that BT has dragged its heels in opening the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access.This month BT finally agreed a halfway house deal to legally separate Openreach, after two years of wrangling with Ofcom, which wants to strengthen the independence of the broadband network operator to promote competition and boost superfast services.The  42m penalty follows a bad week for BT after Ofcom fined subsidiary Plusnet  880,000 for continuing to charge more than 1,000 customers more than  500,000 after they had cancelled their accounts.The fine is the latest headache for Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT, who has endured a torrid year that included an accounting scandal at its Italian operation that wiped  8bn off its shares.?The investigation ? revealed we fell short of the high standards we expect in serving our communications provider customers,? Patterson said. ?We take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again. My management team and I are determined that BT applies the highest standards when serving our customers.?This month BT, which is to introduce inflation-busting price rises for its customers, denied it was forcing them to foot the bill to pay for its new  1.2bn Champions League football rights deal."

In a controversial decision, it has also been mandated for children to get their mid-day meals and for 11 other government schemes.The critics of Aadhaar claim the government is violating a Supreme Court order of October 2015 which specified that the Universal Identification Document cannot be made mandatory for government schemes.

4060,"The meat sellers in various parts of Uttar Pradesh on Monday went on an indefinite strike against state government's crackdown on slaughterhouses. As per All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association, the accumulated losses in the last two months run into ?4,000 crore. The UP government, however, clarified that action is being taken against only illegal slaughterhouses.","Meat items are flying off the menu from a majority of eateries in Uttar Pradesh as a host of illegal abattoirs have been forced to shut shop under the Yogi Adityanath government.The Muslim-dominated western parts, adjoining the national Capital, are among the worst affected, a reality check by MAIL TODAY found.While the debilitated meat supply highlights the fact that erstwhile governments in UP had turned a blind eye to unlawful slaughterhouses, it also proves the incumbent government had no consolidated plan to avoid a crisis-like situation. ""I have not seen such scarcity of raw meat in the last 35 years that we have been in business,"" said Mohamad Khalid, owner of Al-Nafis dhaba at Dasna on NH 24. ""The last 10 days have been harrowing. This is worse than the demonetisation phase,"" said Khalid, the second generation owner of the popular dhaba serving highway frequenters.RS 4,000 CRORE IN LOSSESThe accumulated losses in the last two months since the BJP manifesto promised closure of illegal slaughterhouses runs into Rs 4,000 crore, according to All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association. Association members recently met Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow and requested him to intervene in protecting legal business and clear confusion.Four mechanised plants, which slaughter and process buffalo meat, were shut last week by district administration across UP. Two of them were in Meerut and one each in Bijnor and Saharanpur.The exporters' association said while the move by the government is against illegal slaughterhouses, an overzealous tribe of officers and vigilante groups have forced even legal traders to suspend operations. ""Transporting meat is a risky task nowadays and only very few vehicle-owners are ready to stick their necks out,"" said a meat trader.But numbers speak for themselves. ""UP has only 41 slaughter houses, which are certified by the Union ministry. These units contribute to 60-70 per cent of the total export of buffalo meat, worth around Rs 320 billion. The fear of closure is among the owners' mind, who are now being troubled by several agencies,"" Fauzan Alavi, member secretary of the exporters' association told MAIL TODAY.CERTIFICATION PROCESS A TEDIOUS PROCESS, SAYS SMALL SLAUGHTERHOUSESSeveral small illegal slaughterhouses that the MAIL TODAY team spoke to were united in complaining that certification process for an abattoir is a tedious process, often requiring multiple clearances at the state and central level. ""It is not feasible for a small operator to attain all the clearances,"" said one such owner, who downed shutters soon after Yogi's ascension as CM.The closure of these slaughterhouses has a ripple effect on smaller units selling meat or cooked preparations. A number of small eateries and mobile food carts in Muzaffarnagar and Ghaziabad have been out of business.Chetan, a chicken shop owner at Murad Nagar in Ghaziabad, told MAIL TODAY that 20 members of his family are dependent on his shop, running for seven years. But now, uncertainty looms on them as he could be forced to look for other job. ""Police warned me to shut the shop. I have put a curtain at the entry of my shop to keep business limited only to loyal customers. I will apply for a license at the tehsil office and if I do not get it, I would think of another business like selling vegetables,"" he said.""Taking surprise decisions is the BJP's trademark,"" said owner of a food cart, Ishaan Qureshi, in Muzaffarnagar. ""First it was note ban and now meat ban. We live in an area where economy depends on unorganised sectors. Now people are losing bread and jobs.""Meat shops and eateries in proximity with the national Capital still had an easy run as they shifted their supply route towards Delhi's Ghazipur meat mandi.""Our hotel has a daily consumption of 30-35 kg of buffalo meat that was earlier available in slaughterhouses locally. Now, we are purchasing it from Ghazipur at Rs 170-180 per kg, which is Rs 30 higher than earlier,"" said Mohammad Akhlak, owner of Shahdan Muslim Dhaba on NH 24. ""Ninety per cent of eateries have either suspended operation temporarily or raised prices.""Akhlak said in the last one week police vigilance has been high and seizure of meat consignment always looms large during transportation.

The shooter is reportedly on the run after the incident at the Cameo Club. However, Cincinnati police have confirmed that they have launched a homicide investigation into the attack.","A gunfight broke out inside a crowded Cincinnati nightclub early Sunday, leaving one man dead and 15 others wounded after a dispute among several patrons escalated into a shootout, authorities said.No suspects were in custody by Sunday night in the shooting at the Cameo club, which has a history of gun violence, and police said there was no indication of any terrorism link.Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said one of the wounded was in ""extremely critical condition,"" while a hospital spokeswoman said two victims were listed in critical condition.Police began receiving calls at 1:30 a.m. about gunshots at the club near the Ohio River east of downtown Cincinnati.

""It was just crazy.""Police Sgt. Daniel Hils said the large crowd at the club was a factor in the number of people who suffered gunshot wounds.""When you're talking about something tightly packed like that, I think intended targets aren't going to be the only thing that's hit,"" said Hils, who is president of the Fraternal Order of Police local. ""When you starting throwing lead around, and there's a lot of other people standing around, then the other people are going to get hit.""Isaac said the club has its own security operation that uses detection wands and pat-downs, but that police believe several firearms got inside. Four officers were working security in the club's parking lot and some tried unsuccessfully to revive the man who died.Cameo's Facebook profile said it caters to college students on Friday nights, when anyone over 18 is allowed in, while Saturdays are ""grown and sexy night"" for ages 21 and older.

She said two people were in critical condition and another three were listed in stable condition by late afternoon. She had no details on the types of injuries or the ages of the victims.

Investigators were checking to see if surveillance cameras were working, Williams said.An Associated Press phone call to the club Sunday night went unanswered.The area is mostly industrial but also home to several nightclubs with a smattering of homes. A regional airport is nearby. The neighborhood is fairly desolate at night, with the exception of the nightlife scene and 24-hour gas stations. The road where the club is located was easily cordoned off by a single police cruiser and officer at either end.First responders had problems reaching the shooting victims because the parking lots were full, Sgt.

4112,"Anushka Sharma's Phillauri ""hovers...from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting,"" wrote India Today. ""Phillauri is an unconventional Bollywood entertainer...watchable all the way,"" said NDTV. Hindustan Times wrote, ""Despite a fresh idea, it is a loosely-written film that fails to engross the audience."" It was rated 3/5 (NDTV), 2.5/5 (HT) 1.5/5 (India Today).n","Phillauri is a supernatural comedy where a man gets stuck with a friendly spirit after he is made to marry a tree. Here is our Phillauri movie review.Phillauri Cast: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh, Suraj Sharma, Mehreen PirzadaPhillauri Direction: Anshai LalPhillauri Rating:  (1.5/5) When the friendly spirit Shashi is asked why she is stuck with the soon-to-be-married Kanan, she says, ""Pata nahi, main to yahi atki hui hoon."" Anshai Lal's 138-minute long Phillauri could speak for itself here.Once the one-line idea of guy-getting-married-to-spirit has been established, the film hovers around, like Shashi, from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting nor of any service to whatever goodness the film has.So, Kaneda-return Punjabi boy Kanan, 26, returns to India to get married. Cue: Boisterous Punjabi family scenes during wedding season. Kanan is played superbly by Life Of Pi actor Suraj Sharma. Kanan beat-boxes when he is asked to sing by his family. Later, he escapes them and goes to the roof to roll a J. When his fiance Anu (a decent Mehreen Pirzada) asks if he is ready for the marriage, he goes ""Yo, chill."" Phillauri is pretty entertaining and appears promising in these initial scenes till the point Kanan is married to a tree because of being a manglik and Shashi, the spirit enters his life.Now once this set up has been established, you need solid plot developments to fill the rest of the ninety minutes. This, Phillauri lacks. A premise like this has the potential to deliver a good supernatural comedy a la Beetlejuice or Casper. As such, the usual direction a story like this can take is one where the human(s) and the ghost(s) slowly resolve their innermost crises by being in constant proximity to each other and this is achieved by a series of good, well-written scenes.Now, Kanan's crisis is that 1. he is unsure of getting married and 2. there is a ghost living with him. Shashi's crisis is that she is stuck with Kanan; her story arc is resolved in the most predictable way at the end and it is strange that this was not made the film's focus from the very beginning. As long as Kanan and Shashi are together on screen, for the most part, Phillauri is interesting. In friendly-ghost films like these, it is the way the human and the ghost play off each other and the weird situations they create is what makes these films worth watching.But Kanan-Shashi's parts are punctuated by an elaborate backstory that is just dull and Diljit Dosanjh is a decent performer, sure, but he is not a big enough Khan to make mediocre writing worthwhile. The period-backstory involving Shashi and her lover, played by Diljit, seriously drags the film. Sometimes, the cloying sentimentality of these portions is nauseating and these scenes jut out like a sore thumb in the middle of the fun Kanan-Shashi moments.Phillauri's concept is good and novel. But the delivery is what North Indians call KLPD. The climactic payoff at the end comes way too easily. It's just lazy writing after a point. If only Shashi emerged in the writer's room before filming began and smacked some imagination into Anvita Dutt's head.(The writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)"

4119,"A tree dubbed the 'neem-beer-tree', located in Delhi University's North Campus, has reportedly been secreting an intoxicating white liquid since November 2016.

It smells of toddy (naturally alcoholic sap of palm) and tastes somewhat bitter. But people from the campus and outside collect it to drink. They say it is intoxicating,? said Mahesh Prasad, the head gardener of North Campus.There are around 15 neem trees near the rugby stadium towards the back end of the campus, most of which are more than 50 years old. But only one tree is giving out the sap ? at least 10 litres a day.?This is unusual. It is for the first time that we have witnessed anything of this sort in Delhi,? said CR Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) in Delhi University.Like any watering hole, it?s easy to locate the inebriating tree. The strong beer-like scent can be smelled at least 10 feet, or even more, from the tree. The charade of bottles, buckets and pitchers is also a good enough sign.?I had two to three glasses of the toddy. It was quite intoxicating. I didn?t fall ill after that. As it is a neem tree, I think, it also has some medicinal properties,? said a labourer, in high spirits.Someone has also placed a ladder and tied a bucket right at the source.

The smell is also becoming weaker,? said Vikrant Goswami, a scientific assistant at CEMDE.Scientists from the university?s department of environmental studies are testing ? in the laboratory ? samples of the liquid.?We suspect it is not the kind of toddy which we usually get from palm trees. There is some kind of microbial activity going on inside the tree. The microbe is helping the tree sap to ferment,? said Dr David Kothamasi, assistant professor at the department.It would take at least a month for the test results to be available. In the lab, too, the bottle in which the toddy has been capped started to inflate when its cap was sealed. That?s a signal that the fermentation process has not stopped. Scientists said a similar incident was reported in Varanasi a few years ago.

They say the two women were hallucinating. ?The woman often claimed to have been speaking to her husband and went on without food for days during these bouts. In his statement, the elderly man said that he has been getting them treated by a local doctor, as he did not have enough savings to take them to a hospital,? an official said. Mishra was a linesman retired from the MTNL and gets a monthly pension of Rs 16,000.?He said that the women hardly ate in the last four years and never stepped out of the house. He also said that whenever he took them to the doctor, they refused to tell their symptoms to the doctor because of which they could not be treated,? he added."

""If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less, while Harley will sell more...and invest more,"" he stated.","From Lalit K Jha Washington, Mar 23 (PTI) If India lowers the 100 per cent tariffs imposed on the popular American Harley Davidson motorcycles it could result in more foreign investments in the country, a top White House trade official has argued. ""If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less while Harley will sell more Harleys and invest more,"" Peter Navarro, Director of White House National Trade Council, said in a letter to the editor to The Wall Street Journal.

From talking about how on certain days Shahid would treat her like she was a 'suicide bomber' to his severe mood swings, Kangana bared it all to filmmaker and talk-show host Karan Johar on KJo's show.Shahid went on to tell the magazine, ""When actors start engaging in this table-tennis match through interviews, which the media feeds off, the focus is then on the actors and not the film.

4125,"Scientists have developed a test that can predict the age at which a person could develop Alzheimer's. The test calculates the risk of onset of disease based on genetic markers developed from data of over 70,000 individuals having Alzheimer's and otherwise. Researchers said that while genetics can influence the risk of dementia, a healthy lifestyle can also curb the risk.","Scientists have developed a new genetic test for Alzheimer?s risk that can be used to predict the age at which a person will develop the disease.A high score on the test, which is based on 31 genetic markers, can translate to being diagnosed many years earlier than those with a low-risk genetic profile, the study found. Those ranked in the top 10% in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop Alzheimer?s during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest 10%.Rahul Desikan, of the University of California ? who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individual?s risk of developing Alzheimer?s that year.?That is, if you don?t already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information,? he said.The so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than 70,000 individuals, including patients with Alzheimer?s disease and healthy elderly people.It is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in Alzheimer?s. Around a quarter of patients have a strong family history of the disease, and scientists have shown this is partly explained by a gene called ApoE, which comes in three versions, and is known to have a powerful influence on the risk of getting the most common late-onset type of Alzheimer?s. One version of ApoE appears to reduce risk by up to 40%, while those with two copies (one from each parent) of the high-risk version can increase risk by 12 times.The latest study takes a new approach, showing that, aside from ApoE, there are thousands of background genetic variations that each have a tiny influence on Alzheimer?s risk, but whose cumulative influence is substantial.The researchers first identified nearly 2,000 single letter differences in the genetic code (known as SNPs) and, after ranking them for influence, developed a test based on 31 of the markers. The test was then used to accurately predict an individual?s risk of getting the disease in an independent patient cohort.In people with the high-risk version of ApoE, those ranked in the top 10% of risk on the new test got Alzheimer?s at an average age of 84 years, compared with 95 years for those ranked in the lowest 10%.James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer?s Society, said: ?Preventing the development of dementia symptoms is the holy grail of Alzheimer?s research but to succeed we first need accurate methods to predict who is most likely to develop the condition. This study?s approach was fairly successful at predicting the likelihood of someone developing dementia over the coming year, but needs to be tested further in mixed, non-US populations.? Pickett added that, while the score could help to identify people for trials, it was too early to apply it as a genetic testing tool for use in the clinic.Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer?s Research UK, said that while genetic makeup can influence the chances of developing dementia, a healthy diet, regular physical activity and remaining mentally active can also drive down the risk. ?Genetics is only part of the story and we know that lifestyle factors also influence our risk of developing Alzheimer?s,? she said. ?The best current evidence points to habits we can all adopt to help lower our risk and indicates that what?s good for your heart is also good for the brain.?The findings are published in the journal PLOS Medicine."

4141,"During an interview, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson revealed that he did not want the position and he only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it. Adding that he had not met President Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower, Tillerson said, ""When he asked me...to be Secretary of State, I was stunned.""","Rex Tillerson has said he did not want to be US secretary of state and only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it.The former ExxonMobil oil executive revealed his initial reluctance in an interview published after a controversial trip to Asia and hours before the biggest event of his two months at the state department, an international meeting on Wednesday about how to fight Islamic State (Isis).  ?I didn?t want this job. I didn?t seek this job,? Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation Asia trip. ?My wife told me I?m supposed to do this.?He said he had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect ?about the world? and his experiences as an oil company CEO.?When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,? he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at ExxonMobil, he had expected to retire: ?I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.?However, he said that when he returned to his Texas home after meeting Trump in New York, his wife, Renda St Clair, shook her finger in his face and said: ?I told you God?s not through with you.?He said he now feels his wife had been right: ?I?m supposed to do this.?Not everyone shares that view. Tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country?s top diplomat at the beginning of February. He was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration?s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of Muslim countries.He has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. He did not take the Washington diplomatic press corps with him on his Asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. The sole exception was the journalist from the IJR, a little-known outlet founded by a former Republican operative. The initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.He told the IJR: ?I?m not a big media press access person. I personally don?t need it. I understand it?s important to get the message of what we?re doing out, but I also think there?s only a purpose in getting the message out when there?s something to be done.?When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: ?He was so cagey ? his answer wasn?t even worthy of inclusion.?Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. Senior Republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the White House would not pass Congress. In his remarks to the IJR, however, Tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the US diplomatic establishment.?Looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we?re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,? he said. He said he had not yet talked to Trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: ?We haven?t gotten that far yet.?While in South Korea, Tillerson was reported in the Seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling Korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. In response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. ?They never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn?t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn?t have dinner because I was tired,? he told the IJR. On Tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged Tillerson would skip what would have been his first Nato foreign ministers? meeting in early April in Brussels so he could be in Florida for Trump?s first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The state department spokesman, Mark Toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to Nato and that Tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-Isis meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible Nato meeting."

Although Chief Justice Chellur did not believe this situation was due to the strike but the government pleader, appearing for the state government, told the court that the health care in civic and state-run hospitals was paralysed due to 60 per cent of its workforce not reporting to work.Advocate Prashant Pophale appearing for the Maharashtra Association for Resident Doctors (MARD) pointed out that there have been three incidents wherein patients' relatives have beaten up doctors in Dhule, Mumbai (Sion Hospital) and Nashik in the last few days.WHY THE PUBLIC ANARCHY, ASKS CHIEF JUSTICE CHELLUR Chief Justice Chellur asked, ""Why the public anarchy?

He, however, added that the state has done little to protect the doctors. But Chief Justice Chellur was of the opinion that the resident doctors cannot put the public at large in trouble.

The party is reportedly also in talks with Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan for the campaign ahead of the polls scheduled for April 22.,"After sweeping the civic polls in Maharashtra and almost snatching Mumbai from the Shiv Sena, the BJP has now set its sights on the Delhi municipal corporation. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls are scheduled to take place on April 22, and the BJP, which has been ruling the MCD for over a decade, has planned an aggressive campaign to take on its rivals.Besides the Congress, the BJP will also face challenge from Arvind Kejriwal's the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which is contesting the MCD polls for the first time. A total of 272 seats in North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporation are up for grabs in the election. BJP's CAMPAIGN PLAN FOR MCD POLLSLast week, BJP President Amit Shah appointed a team of five senior leaders to oversee and supervise the poll campaign. The team includes Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Jitendra Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Sanjeev Balyan and Shyam Jaju. ""We are going all out for the MCD polls and have set a very high target for ourselves. Our triumphs in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have given a fresh impetus to our workers and volunteers and to add to that strength, we are bringing in big faces as well,"" a BJP source said.Prominent among the big faces are Amit Shah and Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu who are likely to address a convention of polling booth in-charges at the Ramlila Maidan on March 25. BJP's Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari was quoted by a Hindustan Times report as saying that he will invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a rally in the national capital.The party has also roped in Bhojpuri film star Ravi Kishen to woo the Poorvanchalis (Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh), who form a bulk of voters in Delhi.The Phogat sisters, Geeta and Babita, too will campaign for the BJP in the run up to the MCD polls, while talks with cricketer Shikhar Dhawan are yet to be finalised. BEYOND STAR CAMPAIGNS, WHAT IS BJP PLANNINGThe BJP's rule at the MCD has been tarred by allegations of nepotism and rampant corruption by its councillors. To project a fresh, corruption-free face ahead of the MCD polls, Manoj Tiwari recently announced that the party will not field a single sitting councillor or his/her relative for the upcoming election.The decision took senior BJP councillors in Delhi by surprise but was believed to have the approval of the party's highest leadership. ""Zero-tolerance towards corruption, which is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's style of functioning, has to be our mantra in all party matters, including distribution of tickets,"" Manoj Tiwari said, while brushing off talks of discontentment in the party. ""We are not bothered about the feelings of sitting councillors. We are answerable only to the public, not to the councillors,"" he said.Such sweeping decision in the BJP before the MCD polls comes in the wake of both the Congress and the AAP targeting the BJP-run MCD for corruption. AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly attacked the MCD for having failed to implement Narendra Modi's flagship cleanliness drive on the ground. He called the MCD ""a den of corruption"" which doesn't even ""issue a death certificate without a bribe.""ALSO READ:"

While India's players have been matured enough to leave the onfield rivalry behind, Starc's latest comments could pave the way for another controversy. In 2014, Australian batsman Phil Hughes was killed after being hit on the head by a bouncer. Ever since, there have been serious concerns after batsmen have copped blows on their headgear. Starc, in retrospection, might be embarrassed with his words. Australia, the pioneers of mental disintegration, have been clearly rattled by India's onslaught over the last two decades.

It's a very cliched thing to call any opinion about the country a political opinion.""Many people believe that actors should stay away from talking about anything unrelated to films.

One regional office controls 30-40 branches, while 4-5 regional offices are controlled by one zonal office,"" he told IANS.The associate banks have also offered a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to employees who do not wish to relocate.

The Congress, however, is not in that position and is fast losing the little credibility that it had. The party does not have any standing of its own and is trying to latch on to regional players for face saving.

A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul rejected the plea moved by the real estate baron seeking more time to surrender on the ground that he has moved a mercy plea before the President, and had asked him to surrender by this evening. ""Ansal surrendered around 5-5.30 PM. He is currently lodged in the hospital at Jail No. 3 as he complained of some health issues,"" said a jail official.

The apex court also rejected the plea from the senior advocate seeking a direction for speedy disposal of his mercy plea, pending before the President, saying that it cannot interfere in it as it is an exclusive jurisdiction of the President. The apex court, on March 9, had dismissed Ansals petition for parity with his elder brother Sushil Ansal, who was awarded jail term already undergone by him considering his ""age-related complications"", and directed him to surrender by today to serve the prison term. 69-year-old Gopal Ansal was in jail earlier for around four-and-a-half-month in connection with the case relating to the June 13, 1997 fire tragedy in which 59 persons had died in Uphaar cinema during the screening of Hindi movie Border. Over 100 people were injured in the subsequent stampede. A bench headed by Justice Gogoi, in a 2:1 majority verdict on February 9, had granted relief to 76-year-old Sushil Ansal considering age-related complications by awarding him the jail term already undergone and had asked Gopal to surrender in four weeks to serve the remaining jail term. Gopal had thereafter approached the apex court seeking modification of its order on the grounds of parity, saying he was 69-year-old and would suffer irreparable damage to his health if sent to prison.

""[T]he policy... has already been abandoned by the government because it turned out to be an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg,"" he added.","New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) Describing demonetisation as an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg, eminent Austrian economist Heinz D Kurz has said it is much too weak and misdirected an instrument to root out corruption. Actually, he said, the Indian governments move opened up new avenues of corruption. ""As far as I understand the situation, the policy of demonetisation has already been abandoned by the government, because it turned out to be an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg. ""I strongly doubt that the demonetisation exercise will root out corruption and engender more transparency. It is much too weak and misdirected an instrument to achieve these goals,"" Kurz told PTI in an interview. ""By introducing the Rs 2,000 banknote, a currency of twice or even four times the value of the banknotes that have been declared illegal, in the system... This can hardly be called demonetisation,"" he added. Kurz is a professor of economics at the University of Graz, Austria. Noting that while the goal of fighting corruption is laudable, he said: ""I consider it to be singularly naive to think that this can be done by banning some banknotes. ""There appears also to be evidence that the policy of demonetisation opened new channels of corruption."" Kurz pointed out that whoever was informed about the demonetisation policy ahead of its introduction (sort of insider trading) could have used the information and laundered money. Also, he further said Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes brought to banks were apparently counted, but not scrutinised as to whether it was counterfeit money. Asked about impact of demonetisation on Indias economic growth, Kurz said that ""first, it is much too early to assess already the impact of demonetisation, which will show up only later. Secondly, the data published are rough estimates that do not, and could not possibly, take account of this impact"". ""It would therefore be wrong to infer that demonetisation had no effect on the economy,"" he noted. The Indian economy is going pretty strong, Kurtz said, adding however that not well thought out policies such as the demonetisation project have the potential of affecting it badly. "

Four hundreds on the 2014-15 series in Australia and then two hundreds here along with the 2015 World Cup semi-final hundred. He loves Indian bowling you have got to give him credit.

Their support in polls is a tacit approval of the BJP's stand on the issue,"" said MRM national coordinator Mohammad Afzal.""The fact that the BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate for the UP polls did not deter women of the community to at least in part vote for the party,"" claimed another functionary of the MRM on conditions of anonymity.Afzal also said the traditional clergy of the community needed to wake up. ""The fact that a terrorist was killed and his father denounced him in the light of the latter's love for the nation and then a girl is issued a fatwa against for singing ? all these things point to the changing scenario in India. They should wake up now and stop trying to convert the social evil of triple talaq from a social problem into a religious problem.""Even the great grandson of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, a tall Muslim Congress leader of Indian history, extolled Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his ""positive attitude towards the Muslims"". ""The Ulemas are taking the Muslim community not in the medieval ages, but the dark ages and towards the stone age,"" said Firoze Ahmad Bakht."

4223,"As per an India Today report, the hard disk of Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) portal crashed on November 28 and the data stored online until that date has been lost as it was not backed up. One of those cases which got deleted pertains to alleged corruption in National Textile Corporation under the Textiles Ministry, now headed by Smriti Irani.","In a severe setback to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fight against corruption in public places and his mission to promote Digital India, the portal of the country's anti-graft watchdog Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has not been functioning for about four months now.Sources told India Today that the hard disk of CVC's portal crashed on November 28 and all data stored online till that data has been lost. The problem has been compounded as the data was not backed up.The portal was maintained by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). To make matters worse, CVC's contract with TCS expired in December. There is no annual maintenance contract either between CVC and TCS.The sources said after the grave tragedy, the Centre's web services organisation, National Informatics Centre (NIC), took over the maintenance of the CVC's portal this year. NIC has also been trying to retrieve the old data but without much success.All efforts to talk to senior officials of CVC such as vigilance commissioners Rajiv and TM Bhasin, secretary Nilam Sawhney, additional secretary Salim Haque and director Jyoti Trivedi were in vain.Though new complaints can now be made with CVC and their details would be available, the particulars of almost all the previous cases have been permanently erased.ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN NTCOne of those cases pertain to alleged massive corruption in National Textile Corporation (NTC) under the Union Ministry of Textiles, now headed by Smriti Irani.Mumbai-based whistleblower HR Kosia had filed an RTI application with CVC in 2013 demanding action taken report in an alleged corruption case. He had accused NTC chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) PC Vaish of selling a godown for a song to a private party in 2013.According to Kosia's complaint, Vaish, then NTC's director, finance, had sold off Mumbai-based Poddar Process Malharvadi Kalbadevi worth crores to private builders Om Vastu Shanti for mere Rs 75 lakh. The transaction was allegedly done without due tendering process or without approval from Textiles Ministry and NTC's Board of Directors.The deal was done despite the fact that NTC had won a case against lease holder (Poddar Process) in 2013 when Vaish was finance director.Kosia, who was deputy manager (security and vigilance) with NTC, had to pay a heavy price for bringing to light this corruption and several other cases of irregularities in the Corporation. He was dismissed from service in July, 2016.Kosia's grievance is that the Textiles Ministry neither filed any chargesheet against him nor lodged an FIR nor had a 'panchnama' done.SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS IN CVCFinally, Kosia filed an RTI in the Commission. After several communications, CVC director and Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Jyoti Trivedi replied on December 22, 2016, saying that ""due to technical problem in the working of complaint portal of the Commission, it is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaint at this stage"".She added that the appellate authority in the matter was CVC additional secretary Praveen Sinha.Kosia petitioned Sinha, saying that the CPIO's response was not legally valid as per RTI Act 2005. Sinha replied to Kosia on January 24, and admitted that the ""corruption case lodged with CVC required action taken reports copy"".In his decision, Sinha said, ""I have gone through the relevant records and find that at the time of giving a reply to the appellant (Kosia), the complaint portal was not functioning and this position was intimated to the appellant by the CPIO.""I direct the CPIO concerned (Jyoti Trivedi) to confirm the position regarding complaints mentioned by the appellant in his RTI application and provide an appropriate reply to him within 15 days of the receipt of these orders,"" he said.Sinha further said, ""The issues raised by the appellant have thus been addressed appropriately. However, if the appellant is not satisfied with the above decision, he can make an appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC). The appeal is accordingly disposed (of).""Following the appellate authority's decision, Jyoti Trivedi sent a second reply to Kosia. In her letter dated February 9, she said, ""TCS system of the Commission is still not working. It is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaints at this stage.""Kosia has now made a second appeal to CIC. He also apprehends some major conspiracy behind the whole episode. ""The portal crashing on November 28, CVC's contract with TCS ending just next month, no AMC either between the two and there is no back up of data - all these cannot be coincidences. There is more to it than meets the eye. The PM should have an inquiry ordered into it,"" he said. The fate of Kosia's application is uncertain and so does that of thousands of such cases. While the whistleblowers struggle, action against several alleged corrupt government officials may not be taken ever, dealing a severe blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's crusade against corruption.WATCH: Modi government has zero tolerance on corruption, says his ministerALSO READ: PM Modi thanks diaspora for supporting war against black money, corruptionNo report of RTI activist murder during last 3 years with CVC"
4224,"The Rajkummar Rao starrer 'Trapped' which released on Friday ""manages to grippingly hold your attention with...an underwhelming setting..."", wrote Mid-Day. ""The film is compelling but it could have been more cleverly plotted"", wrote NDTV while India Today said ""Rajkummar Rao and his terrific act deserve a watch"". It was rated 4/5 (Mid-Day), 3.5/5 (NDTV, India Today).","Trapped, directed by Vikramaditya Motwane and starring Rajkummar Rao in the lead role, is in theatres this week. How good or bad is Trapped? Here is our Trapped movie review.Trapped Cast: Rajkummar Rao, Geetanjali ThapaTrapped Director: Vikramaditya MotwaneTrapped Rating:(3.5/5)Trapped. The word is onomatopoeic. You know what it means. You know the feeling. You know the helplessness. So when a man is trapped in his own house, without food, water or electricity, how does he survive? Because survive he must. On the other side of this ordeal lies his version of the Promised Land. At least what he has promised to himself: Noorie and he will have many babies. While he is haunted by the pessimistic What ifs.Director Vikramaditya Motwane gives Bollywood a fantastic albeit loopholed survival thriller in Trapped. It feels a bit weird to realise that as a director, Motwane is just two-films old... even though both of them (Udaan and Lootera) were artistic marvels in themselves. In Trapped, Motwane carries forward the legacy he seems to have inherited from the Anurag Kashyap school of filmmaking. The director's efforts shine through in every frame, in every sigh that his protagonist takes, in every moment that the viewer sits trapped inside the theatre with his/her gaze constantly travelling to the glowing EXIT sign. Trapped makes you feel trapped, but not in the way an MSG film would make you. You feel every bit helpless as Shaurya (Rajkummar Rao), who wakes up, takes his first step outside his new house, walks back in to get his mobile phone, and wham goes the door.Trapped is the story of the much-in-love-with-his-colleague Shaurya, who tries all awkward proposal techniques till Noorie (Geetanjali Thapa) goes out on a date with him. She is to get married in two months. ""Arranged marriage?"" Shaurya asks. She nods. Two months pass by in the blink of an eye, and two days before Noorie is to take the train home to get married, Shaurya promises to move out of his flat that he shares with three other guys, to a new home. He'll arrange everything in a day, he tells her.A shady broker catches Shaurya trying to cut a deal with other agents. He takes Shaurya to a high-rise which is yet to have residents move in. Some court-case jhamela, says the broker. All too relatable if you have had the (mis)fortune of hunting for a flat in a short period of time in a city like Mumbai or Delhi. Shaurya moves to this new flat, the door to which needs a bit of push from the outside if you want to get in. When he wakes up the next morning, there's no electricity, his phone's running out of battery, there's no water.In Trapped, Motwane captures an entire panoply of emotions on Rao's face. Rao goes from irritation to anger to helplessness to fear, dangling between hope and despair, and clutching on to dear life. There are many close-ups of Rao's face, and he nails nearly all of them. Besides the mostly taut story, Trapped relies heavily on its lead actor. And Rao throws his lot with the film. He does a fabulous job as Shaurya, adding another feather to his already-decked cap.There's a rat, there are occasional visits from pigeons. Shot in a month and inside a flat in Mumbai, Trapped tells a tale of survival peppered with the occasional humour and a few heart-in-the-mouth scenes. Therefore when the film fails to address some basic questions, you feel let down. When Shaurya goes missing, for example, there doesn't seem to be a single family member or friend or colleague concerned about his whereabouts. It's almost as if the guy exists in vacuum. You hope for some sort of answer towards the end, but there's silence there too.The runtime of the film works in its favour. In less than 2 hours, your patience levels are fine. The absence of songs makes sure the pace of Trapped is not hampered.Watch Trapped this week. Be thankful that you have the option of opening a door and getting out. And make sure you double-check the locks before that door shuts and you're, well, you know.(The writer tweets as @ananya116.)"
4225,"The first Indian-origin woman in space, Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962. Chawla moved to the United States in 1982 and joined NASA in 1988. Describing her first mission in space, she said, ""You are just your intelligence"", on experiencing weightlessness. The astronaut died with six crew members on her second mission aboard the Columbia spacecraft in 2003.","For two months after she became the first Indian woman to be launched in space, 35-year-old Kalpana Chawla, the Karnal-born scientist, remained incommunicado. That's largely because the National Space and Aeronautical Administration (NASA), the authority that controls space flights in the US, was investigating what went wrong with one of the missions that Chawla and her five other crew members had to undertake during their 15-day space odyssey in November last year. Chawla was assigned the task of releasing Spartan, the $10 million (Rs 40 crore) solar-physics satellite from the space shuttle's bay. Either a systems malfunction or an error of judgement caused it to spin out of control and it took a daring space walk by the crew to retrieve it. NASA investigation showed it was the result of a series of small errors and absolved Chawla, calling her ""a terrific astronaut"". In an exclusive telephone interview from Houston, she spoke to Deputy Editor Raj Chengappa last week. Excerpts:Q. When you were first free from the clutches of gravity after lift-off, can you describe the physical and mental feeling?A. When you lift off the pressure is supposed to be maximum. But actually it was very benign. Very enjoyable. But as soon as the engines cut off and you get to zero gravity, you felt as if you were being pushed off your seat. You feel disoriented. You don't feel aligned with anything. I felt for a few good hours that I was falling. In fact, you are in a free fall- that's what zero gravity is all about. But the first few hours, the workload was so much that it was hard to realise the magic of the experience. But afterwards the feeling was literally out of this world.Q. What is the strangest thing about being in zero gravity?A. One of the strangest things is that when I was about to sleep, I realised I was only aware of my thoughts. Because you are weightless you don't feel your legs or your body. In a sense then, you are just your intelligence. It's amazing you can't feel anything but your consciousness.Q. How did you feel about becoming the first Indian woman to be in space?A. I never truly thought of being the first or second someone. Or being a small-town girl. This is just something I wanted to do. It was very important for me to enjoy it. If you want to do something, what does it matter where you are ranked? Nor does being a woman make a difference. We were all just crew members.Q. Did looking down at the earth from space change your concept of it?A. It did. The first view of the earth is magical. All of us had grown fond of watching the Himalayas pass by. I saw the Brahmaputra and how it turned to meet the Ganges. And the Ganges delta looked very serene. What is mindboggling is the tremendous speed we were going at. We crossed the Himalayas in less than two minutes, and then you realise, ""Oh My God"" within an hour and a half, we have gone around the whole planet. It is a very overpowering realisation that the earth is so small. The atmosphere looks like a ribbon with different colours hugging the earth. That, in addition, lends so much to its fragility. It affected me. I could not get over the notion that in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on.Q. Did you think about Karnal or India?A. We passed over India lots of times. And sometimes I would think, oh I have been there. Especially while passing over New Delhi. You couldn't really spot it but I pointed it out to my crew members and said I lived near there. But I really didn't see countries by themselves, I just saw land.Q. Does the earth look all blue from up there?A. The earth is not just a bluish hue. You actually see all the colours. It was spectacular. For example, when the Sahara comes into view, the ocean near it is an emerald green. It is shockingly beautiful. The Sahara itself looks golden brown. Then you cross the Nile, and it looks like a deep, dark green ribbon and immediately you can tell why it is the lifeline of the desert.Q. How did it affect you? A. The nice thing about it is that if there are any blemishes, it is lost. Everything looks pretty. It is as if the whole place is sacred. You get the feeling that I need to work extraordinarily hard along with other human beings to respect that.Q. Do you see the pollution?A. I did see it and it was one of the unfortunate sights. For instance, you can see smokestacks. We saw fires, one over Australia. We also saw smog layers over Taiwan.Q. Did you long for Indian food when you were up in space?A. My crewmates, especially my Japanese colleague who loves curries, would say: ""How can you survive with the stuff we are eating here?"" I would just laugh it off. I didn't miss it much.Q. Did you feel Indian or a sense of Indianness?A. To the contrary. On one of the night passes, I dimmed the lights in the flight deck and saw the stars. When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land but from the solar system. I could extend the whole thing-maybe one day people will go to other galaxies and then what would we say? Where did we come from? I am a resident of the Milky Way?Q. What exactly happened during the Spartan satellite release manoeuvre? What malfunctioned?A. We don't know about the malfunction part. NASA is looking into all these things. It isn't one big thing but a number of small things that made us get to where we were at the end.Q. Were you hurt by some of the reports in the Indian media that blamed you?A. I just haven't had the time to look at the reports. But NASA did not blame me at all. I wasn't hurt because I figured that in the end everyone would know what the truth was.Q. What was your immediate feeling when things went wrong?A. At that time, one is so busy and focused on the task that one doesn't feel anything. My immediate feeling was that we had 13 more days to go, with plenty of experiments that had nothing to do with the satellite. This included a space walk. And we had to focus on our mission and make the best of it.Q. When you returned, what was the first thing you wanted to do?A. I wanted to go on a canoeing trip and feel the wind in my face. That's one thing you miss when you're out there. I missed the fresh air."

And after the Jaipur attack, Bhansali shifted base to Kolhapur in Maharashtra to resume the shooting of the film. But if reports are to be believed, the sets were once again attacked on Tuesday night, this time in Kolhapur. According to reports, 40-50 unidentified men tried to vandalise the sets and set it on fire. The men, armed with lathis and stones, stormed into the sets and started destroying the property. Reportedly, a few cars parked outside the sets were also damaged. ""Police is probing this matter and further investigation is on.

Interestingly, the filmmaker beefed up the security after the Jaipur incident where he was manhandled by members of the Karni Sena and accused of distortion of history in Padmavati. The reason for the attack was that Bhansali was allegedly showing a romantic sequence between 14th century emperor Alauddin Khilji (played by Ranveer Singh) and Rani Padmini (played by Deepika Padukone), an incident which the Karni Sena claims had never happened in history and thus, filming the same would be an insult to the Rajputana pride.Interestingly, the filmmakers had never planned to have such a scene in the first place. Moreover, Rani Padmini is a character that was first written of in an epic poem named Padmavat by 16th century Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Padmini's existence is a matter of debate among historians. Meanwhile, it is reported Bhansali is safe, but the shooting of the film has been stalled till further notice.

Justice S Muralidhar, however, did not agree with the stand taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), saying ""there is no point in going over it all over again"". ""RBI has already undertaken the exercise (of looking into the award) twice over. It might be better to tell the court, whether there is any statutory provision or regulation barring transfer of money overseas under the award,"" the judge said.

Senior advocate Soli Sorabjee, appearing for the RBI, told the court that the bank would not press its application to intervene in the matter if it can take a fresh look into the award granted in favour of Docomo. This contention was opposed by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Darius Khambata, appearing for Docomo and Tata Sons respectively. They said that on March 8, the court had asked RBI to make its stand clear by showing the rule, regulation or circular under which the banks permission is required before transfer of money overseas under the award. The lawyers for the two companies said that the RBI cannot keep it open ended by looking into afresh. "

4252,"Employers may bar staff from wearing visible religious symbols, including women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday. However, customers cannot demand that workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, it stated. Notably, this is the EU court's first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work.","Politicians on the right have welcomed a ruling by the EU?s highest court that allows companies to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols, as a long-awaited legal judgment ricocheted into the French and Dutch election campaigns.In its first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, the European court of justice in Luxembourg ruled the garments could be banned, but only as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols.Nor can customers simply demand workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, the court ruled on Tuesday.The long-awaited ruling came on the eve of Dutch elections, where Muslim immigration has been a contentious issue. In France, where the race to succeed President Fran ois Hollande remains wide open, politicians on the right seized on the issue.Fran ois Fillon, the presidential candidate who has taken a hardline stance on Islam?s place in France, welcomed the judgment. On the day he was placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds he said in a statement that it was ?an immense relief, not just for thousands of companies but also for their workers?. He said the ruling would be ?a factor in cohesion and social peace?, particularly in France.Gilbert Collard, an MP for the Rassemblement Bleu Marine, which supports Marine Le Pen?s Front National, claimed the ruling was an endorsement. ?Even the ECJ votes Marine,? he wrote on Twitter.In Germany, the rightwing populist party, Alternative f r Deutschland, also welcomed the ruling: ?The ECJ?s ruling sends out the right signal, especially for Germany,? said the AfD?s Berlin leader, Georg Pazderski. ?Of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.?The ECJ issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from France and Belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.?An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,? the court said.It ruled that a company?s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.The first case was referred to the ECJ by the Belgian courts. Samira Achbita had been a receptionist for the Belgian branch of G4S, the London-listed outsourcing and security company when, after three years at the firm she decided she wanted to start wearing a headscarf at work for religious reasons. Achbita was fired in June 2006 for refusing to take off her scarf. The company said she had broken unwritten rules prohibiting religious symbols.In the second case, Asma Bougnaoui, a design engineer, was fired from an IT consultancy firm, Micropole, after a customer complained that his staff had been ?embarrassed? by her headscarf while she was on their premises to give advice. She had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company?s customers.In Achbita?s case the ECJ followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.?The court of justice finds that G4S?s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction. The rule thus treats all employees to the undertaking in the same way, notably by requiring them, generally and without any differentiation, to dress neutrally.?In Bougnaoui?s case the court?s adviser had ruled that she had suffered discrimination. She had been ?professionally competent? and sacked only because she had refused to remove her headscarf, the advocate general advised.The court upheld this view with a less ringing endorsement. It said customers? wishes not to be served by a worker wearing a headscarf did not give companies a get-out clause from EU anti-discrimination law. ?However, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer?s services provided by a worker wearing an Islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.?The ECJ did not rule on whether Bougnaoui?s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the French court to determine.The German broadsheet S ddeutsche Zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how German courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since 2002 had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds. The ruling, which is more nuanced than a straightforward ban, could sow confusion about which religious symbols can be worn at work. Some legal experts said it seemed to cut against a ruling from the European court of human rights (ECHR) that allowed crosses to be worn.Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Essex University, said the latest ECJ ruling looked awkward when set against the ECHR judgment that wearing religious symbols is ?sometimes an employee?s right to manifest freedom of religion?. He said the ECJ had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.The ECHR is the high court of the 47-member Council of Europe and not part of the EU. Traditionally, the EU court in Luxembourg confined itself to evening out distortions in Europe?s single market, but its remit has grown as EU law has expanded.The ruling prompted dismay from some religious groups. The Conference of European Rabbis, which comprises 700 Jewish leaders across Europe, said Europe was sending a clear message that its faith communities were no longer welcome. Referring to the rise of racially motivated incidents, Pinchas Goldschmidt, the group?s president, called on politicians to ensure Europe did not isolate religious minorities.Maryam H?madoun at the Open Society Justice Initiative said she was disappointed by the ruling, which she described as discrimination against people who chose to show their religion in their dress. ?It will lead to Muslim women being discriminated in the workplace, but also Jewish men who wear kippas, Sikh men who wear turbans, people who wear crosses. It affects all of them, but disproportionately Muslim women,? she said.Stephen Evans, the campaigns director at the National Secular Society in the UK, said: ?Where a ban on employees wearing religious or political symbols is founded on a general company rule of religious and political neutrality, and where that rule is applied equally to all, it can?t be realistically argued that that this constitutes ?less favourable treatment?.?Religious and political neutrality is a perfectly reasonable aim and, where businesses and organisations wish to present themselves in such a way, this ruling demonstrates that this approach is perfectly consistent with equality and human rights law.?Angelique Chrisafis contributed to this report"

The former Real Madrid youth trainee Joselu gave Deportivo a deserved lead in the 40th minute after an error by the Bar a goalkeeper, Marc-Andr  ter Stegen, although Luis Su rez equalised after 46 minutes with a powerful drilled effort.The Depor defender Alex Bergantinos headed them back in front after 74 minutes and Barcelona, who were without Neymar because of a thigh injury and clearly missed the Brazilian?s creative talents, failed to react.Su rez was denied a second equaliser by a brilliant save from Germ n Lux as Baecelona suffered a first defeat in 20 league games since being beaten 4-3 at Celta Vigo, also in Galicia, on 2 October.Depor went into the game one place above the relegation zone but are on the rise under new coach Pepe Mel, who has now taken eight points in four games since succeeding the sacked Gaizka Garitano last month.The Galicians were far from intimidated by Barca?s recent run of scoring 17 goals in their previous three outings, and did not allow the champions to settle. Joselu fired a venomous shot at goal in the first real attempt for either side, forcing an outstanding save from Ter Stegen to force a corner.The German let himself down a minute later, though, letting the ball slip out of his hands from a tame shot and Joselu gobbled it up to score from close range.Barca made the ideal start to the second half as Suarez instinctively drilled a loose ball under Lux to pull level, but they could not faze the home side, who soon set about restoring their lead.Alejandro Arribas rattled the post with a header and Deportivo were wrongly given a corner, which they took full advantage of as Bergantinos outmuscled Jordi Alba to head home.?We let them get into the game for too long in the first half and this is what football is like, when you give a team an advantage they always punish you,? Suarez told reporters.?The PSG result did not cost us today, we?ve had enough days to recover. Deportivo are fighting relegation and we knew it was going to be difficult here but we?re not going to give up the fight for La Liga.?"

The eggs found during excavations of a dinosaur nest near Lisbon extends knowledge of eggs by four crore years, said a palaeontologist.","London, Mar 10 (PTI) The worlds oldest known crocodile eggs laid some 152 million years ago have been discovered in the cliffs of Portugal. The remarkably well preserved eggs give an insight into the ""mother croc"" that laid them, researchers said. They are similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles, suggesting crocodile eggs have changed little in shape in the last 150 million years. Palaeontologists say the prehistoric crocodile ancestor would have spanned two metres, based on the size of the larger eggs. ""The fact that they are from the Late Jurassic makes these eggs the oldest crocodilian eggs known so far,"" said Joao Russo of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. ""This new discovery from Portugal extends the knowledge of this type of egg by approximately 40 million years,"" said Russo. Crocodilians arose some 200 million years ago, when they prowled the land with early dinosaurs. "
4291,"IT services major Infosys became the first India-registered company to be listed on NASDAQ on March 11, 1999. Infosys Technologies was also the first Indian company to be added to the NASDAQ-100 index, which lists 100 largest non-financial stocks in terms of market capitalisation. NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalisation.","Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies. Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income. There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe.

""If your student does not pass his examinations even after using our pen set, then we will return the entire amount,"" read a note in Gujarati in the handbill. The 100 per cent guarantee is written in bold letters at the top of the handbill, which also features a photograph of the incredible inventor.The authorities have also ensured that the invention does not fall into the wrong hands.

The city gave its permission for the bull to remain.This week, McCann New York, a top advertising agency, installed the statue of the girl before dawn Tuesday - with a city permit for one week.

The CBFC was also informed that anti-smoking short films are not being played during the film even though it has scenes featuring substance abuse. ""These are serious offences,"" said Nihalani.","Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut and their latest film Rangoon is in new trouble. The film has rubbed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) the wrong way, as a result of which, it might land in a legal mess.Rangoon, directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, is playing in theatres without a censor certificate and the anti-tobacco short films. As a result, the CBFC is mighty miffed with the makers of Rangoon. While on the one hand, Rangoon any which way, hasn't been getting any love at the ticket windows, this will end up adding to the plethora of problems the film is battling.Pahlaj Nihalani, the chairperson of the CBFC, told DNA, ""It has been brought to our notice that Rangoon has been playing in theatres across the country and outside India without the censor certificate and without the anti-smoking short films, which are compulsory for all films that show actors smoking and/or drinking. Rangoon had many scenes showing the main leads indulging in serious substance abuse. We asked the makers to put a disclaimer ahead of the opening credits. That disclaimer has gone missing. Now, we have been informed that the anti-smoking films do not play at the beginning and after the intermission. And also that the censor certificate is not flashed at the start, as per law. These are serious offences.""The film, which is a love story set against the backdrop of the World War II, stars Saif Ali Khan as film producer Rusi Bilimoria, Kangana Ranaut as the fiesty Miss Julia (a character based on Fearless Nadia), and Shahid Kapoor as Jamadar Nawab Malik of the British Indian Army.Rangoon, said Nihalani, has flouted several rules set by the CBFC. And if found true, the CBFC chairman told the tabloid, action will be taken against the team.""We are taking legal action against the digital operators, to begin with. We would not like to point fingers at anyone else for the lapse at this time. It is the digital operators' responsibility to play exactly the length that is shown to us and certified by the CBFC. Not a second more or less of footage must be shown in theatres than what we have certified. The exact length of the film that is shown to us and certified by us is mentioned in the censor certificate. If the anti-smoking films have been removed from the beginning and after intermission and if the censor certificate is not being shown in Rangoon, then, the digital operators are screening less footage than what has been approved by the CBFC. It is a serious offence. We are investigating to see how deep the offence goes,"" said Nihalani.The CBFC head went on to add, ""Maybe some self-appointed intellectuals of our film industry feel it is okay to break the law as long as they can ridicule the jurisdiction of the CBFC.""

Batting against Pakistan in Ahmedabad, Gavaskar, needing 58 runs to reach the milestone, scored 63 runs in India's first innings. The batsman went on to register 10,122 runs in his Test career before retiring after his 125th Test match.","Talk about small steps and giant leaps. On March 7, 1987, a quick single nudged through the slips to a Pakistani bowler named Ejaz Fakih took Sunil Manohar Gavaskar from his innings score of 57 to 58 at the Sardar Patel Stadium in rural Motera outside Ahmedabad. That run also took Gavaskar to a territory which, never mind the batsman, even cricket itself had never seen. Fifty seven to fifty eight sent Gavaskar from 9,999 to the first 10,000th run in Test cricket. Non-striker Kiran More says Gavaskar celebrated that moment like he usually didn't do in cricket. He sprinted. Or at least that's what it seemed like to millions watching TV because it was an accomplishment that all of India wanted to own quickly. So we believe that in that instant, this deliberate, determined Indian batsman was quicker than usual. His head slightly lowered, mid-single, Gavaskar raised his bat in both triumph and celebration. AlsoBy evening, he was out for 63 and they say when he returned to the dressing room, at first he was not satisfied, but furious. Gavaskar's principle never changed: every run counted, every innings had to be maximised. So 10,000 had been achieved but to not extend that innings of 63 irked him. If he ever got out after getting in, dressing rooms would usually clear out to give the infuriated maestro his space. When play ended, what he did have though, was contentment, ""I would have just been happy with 1,000 runs. Now I feel 10 times more fantastic."" No wonder, even in the dry state of Gujarat that night, they sourced some champagne to go with the cake. India did not know it then but Gavaskar was to play only one more Test after Ahmedabad. When he retired later that year, the country was in deep gloom: Indian cricket's defender, its most gritty general had gone. He had re-defined the standards of excellence and professionalism, re-written definitions in the school of Indian batsmanship. It is said he has no mementos from the match in which he crossed 10,000, but he wouldn't need any: Sunil Gavaskar's achievement always carries with it the power of everlasting memory. --by Sharda Ugra"

The reinforced hydrogel contains 40% water and is environment-friendly. The flexible material could be used in manufacturing, fashion, and even making artificial human body joints, which are subject to strong load-bearing tensions, researchers said.","Tokyo, Feb 27 (PTI) Scientists have created a highly flexible material that is tougher than steel, by combining hydrogels with woven glass fibre fabric, which may have a wide range of potential applications. Efforts are currently underway around the world to create materials that are friendly to both society and the environment. Among them are those that comprise different materials, which exhibit the merits of each component. Researchers from Hokkaido University in Japan focused on creating a reinforced material using hydrogels. Though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term use has been produced. To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass fibre fabric to create bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce reinforced plastics. Researchers found that a combination of polyampholyte (PA) gels, a type of hydrogel they developed earlier, and glass fibre fabric with a single fibre measuring around 10 micrometres in diameter produced a strong, tensile material. The procedure to make the material is simply to immerse the fabric in PA precursor solutions for polymerisation. When used alone, the fibre-reinforced hydrogels developed by the team are 25 times tougher than glass fibre fabric, and 100 times tougher than hydrogels - in terms of the energy required to destroy them. Combining these materials enables a synergistic toughening. The team theorises that toughness is increased by dynamic ionic bonds between the fibre and hydrogels, and within the hydrogels, as the fibres toughness increases in relation to that of the hydrogels. Consequently, the newly developed hydrogels are 5 times tougher compared to carbon steel. ""The fibre-reinforced hydrogels, with a 40 per cent water level, are environmentally friendly,"" said Jian Ping Gong, from Hokkaido University in Japan. "

4430,"US-based scientists have devised a computer method called 'ZeitZeiger' that uses blood samples to accurately predict circadian time, the time of day according to a person's body clock. ZeitZeiger used 15 genes from across human genome to predict body's internal time which, the scientists say, could be used to help diagnose and monitor sleep-related disorders and also to personalise treatments.","Washington, Feb 28 (PTI) Scientists have developed a novel computer method called ZeitZeiger that uses a sample of blood to accurately predict circadian time - the time of day according to a persons body clock. ""Our study demonstrates a method for predicting a persons internal time of day that could eventually be used to help diagnose and monitor circadian- and sleep-related disorders, and also to personalise treatments,"" said Jake Hughey from Vanderbilt University in the US. ""This is the first study to use genome-wide expression data from many individuals to develop a biomarker of the circadian clock in human blood,"" Hughey said. ""Previous efforts to monitor the circadian clock in human tissues were based on a small number of individuals and/or a small set of pre-selected genes. Our method, ZeitZeiger, uses 15 genes from across the human genome to predict circadian time,"" he said. The researchers were surprised to find that 13 out of these 15 genes were not core genes of the human circadian clock. Core genes are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. They can be compared to the gears of a mechanical watch. ""Most of the genes that were selected for ZeitZeiger seem to be outputs of the clock; that is they are not the gears controlling the clock, but the hands telling the time. ""This shows that when given data for almost every gene in the genome, the algorithm can figure out which set of genes gives the best predictions, even if they are not core clock genes,"" Hughey said. In addition to predicting circadian time, the researchers demonstrated that ZeitZeiger can also be used to show how disruptions to sleep-wake and light-dark cycles affect the circadian clock. The rhythms produced by the circadian clock differ widely between individuals at any given time of day and they are often disrupted by modern environments, for example due to shift work or reduced exposure to sunlight. Circadian dysfunction is linked to conditions such as cancer, depressive disorder and obesity. Knowledge of an individuals circadian rhythms could be used to optimise the timing of therapeutic interventions, which is known as chronotherapy. "

In Mandsaur, a middle aged woman tried to do self immolation outside the district collector's office on Monday alleging police was not registering  her complaint against a BJP leader who had allegedly outraged he modesty on Sunday.BJP LEADERS BOOKED In Morena, another women levelled rape charges against a block level BJP leader on Tuesday around the same time when the home minister was busy justifying the high rape figures across the state. The Morena victim has alleged she was taken to a lonely place on the pretext of getting her a ration card and was raped by the BJP leader for two days.In Chhattarpur, a 75 year-old woman who was raped by her tenant on Sunday is battling for her life in a Gwalior Hospital.In the state capital Bhopal, a three year old girl was allegedly raped by the director of a high profile play school on February 23. The victim's parents have alleged that police did not register a case till February 27 and that the accused was yet to be arrested.India Today cited all the cases quoted above to the state home minister and to which he replied  by saying that the police was doing its job and that no rapist would be spared."

""We must understand that they're emotional as Mahi bhai never played here,"" said Saurabh.","Fans who turned up to watch a MS Dhoni special returned disappointed even as Jharkhand cruised to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Services for their second victory in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Tuesday.Chasing a stiff 277, Jharkhand did not require services of their captain 'cool' as Saurabh Tiwary (102 not out off 103 balls; 3x4, 6x6) and Ishank Jaggi (116 not out off 92 balls; 10x4, 4x6) put together an unbroken 214-run partnership to script a fluent chase with 22 balls to spare.He may not have played a role with the bat but Dhoni's tips during the drinks break played a big role in their win, Jaggi later revealed.

The Commission will verify the signatures on it and will organise the voting on 10 places in the respective constituency of MP or MLA, it says.

4443,"A female engineer at American carmaker Tesla has accused the Elon Musk-led company of ignoring her complaints of ""pervasive harassment"" and paying her a lower salary than men doing the same work. The engineer's discrimination lawsuit, filed last year, also claims harassment from men on the factory floor ""including... inappropriate language, whistling, and cat calls.""","A female engineer at Tesla has accused Elon Musk?s car company of ignoring her complaints of ?pervasive harassment?, paying her a lower salary than men doing the same work, promoting less qualified men over her and retaliating against her for raising concerns.The allegations of AJ Vandermeyden, who still works at the celebrated electric car manufacturer, paint a picture of a hostile work environment dominated by men where inappropriate sexual behavior is tolerated and women face numerous barriers to advance their careers.Vandermeyden, 33, shared her story with the Guardian at a time when Silicon Valley is reeling from the explosive allegations of former Uber engineer Susan Fowler. In a viral blogpost, she alleged that management and HR dismissed her complaints about documented sexual harassment and sexism, protected a repeat offender because he was a ?high performer? and suggested that women in the company were not as skilled as men.Offering a rare public account of discrimination from a tech worker who remains employed at her company, Vandermeyden said her dedication to Tesla motivated her to advocate for fair treatment and reforms ? despite the serious risks she knows she faces for going public. ?Until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she said in a recent interview, her first comments about a discrimination lawsuit she filed last year. ?I?m an advocate of Tesla. I really do believe they are doing great things. That said, I can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.? Vandermeyden began at Tesla in 2013 and was eventually promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in the general assembly department, which consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over, according to her complaint. It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to haveIt was common for her to be the only woman in meetings with 40 to 50 men, she said on a recent morning, seated in the living room of her family?s house in San Carlos, the city where Tesla was founded, located across the bay from its current factory in Fremont.Currently, all chief executive positions are held by men at Tesla, and out of more than 30 vice-presidents, only two are women, she added. ?It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have.?Vandermeyden said that when complaints arise at Tesla about workplace issues or inequality, the response is often: ??We?re focused on making cars. We don?t have time to deal with all this other stuff.??Tesla, founded in 2003, has gained international recognition for its battery-powered vehicles and ?autonomous? driving technology, promoted by Musk, the ambitious entrepreneur who makes headlines for bold pledges about space travel, artificial intelligence, underground tunnels and driverless cars.But Vandermeyden?s complaint, filed last fall, alleges that there were inadequacies in the quality testing of cars, and that she raised issues about the flaws she observed, which supervisors and male engineers had missed. Although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions above her, her lawyers wrote. She and other female engineers were denied promotions even though they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men, according to the complaint. At the same time, she also experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?, the lawsuit said. Vandermeyden recounted to the Guardian an incident in 2015 when she said a group of roughly 20 men standing on a platform above her and a female colleague began taunting as they walked past. ?They all started hooting and hollering and whistling,? she said. ?That can?t happen without somebody noticing ? It?s disturbing.? But her objections about sexual harassment and unequal pay only caused her more trouble, according to her complaint. The lawsuit alleges that after she raised concerns in the fall of 2015, management told her that in order to advance her position, she needed to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was unattainable and not expected of male engineers. Despite positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department where she continues to work today, according to her suit. The lawsuit said Tesla also denied her overtime pay, rest breaks and meal periods when she worked in sales, and retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower? when she raised concerns about cars ?sold in a defective state?.Some of her claims of mistreatment echo those that have recently emerged from Tesla factory workers, who allege that they have to work long hours for low wages in unsafe conditions. Musk has vigorously denied those claims and criticized an effort by workers to unionize. Tesla initially declined to respond to the Guardian?s questions about Vandermeyden?s claims, but after publication of this report, released a statement on Tuesday defending its actions and refuting her allegations. A spokesperson said that Tesla had hired a ?neutral third party? last year to investigate her accusations and that an ?exhaustive review of the facts? concluded her ?claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have not been substantiated?.The company added in its statement: ?Tesla is committed to creating a positive workplace environment that is free of discrimination for all our employees.?Therese Lawless, Vandermeyden?s lawyer, criticized the investigation, saying, ?We did not believe that it was a comprehensive report ... We vehemently disagree with their finding.?Vandermeyden?s suit said she has suffered ?mental distress? and ?humiliation?.In an interview, she said it takes a toll on her knowing that her work is undervalued. ?Equal pay is something that is essentially in the back of your mind every single day,? she said. ?You have all these data points showing how you?ve exceeded some of the predecessors and improved on the system. It wears on you.? It?s very difficult for women to come forward. They?re concerned that their career is going to be jeopardizedMany women in similar positions choose not to speak up, Lawless said. ?It?s very difficult for women to come forward. They?re concerned that their career is going to be hindered or jeopardized.?

They brought to the apex court's attention the observation of another bench that struck down a similar state law. The plea will be heard on March 2. The Maharashtra government had over a decade ago suspended the licences of bars and hotels where young women were employed to dance to racy film songs for male customers, claiming they were a bad influence on society.But the top court said last year that bars could once again apply for licences.SUPREME COURT'S JUDGMENTThe SC had in an earlier judgment said, ""It has been brought on the record that many of them (bar dancers) have been compelled to take up prostitution out of necessity for maintenance of their families. In our opinion, the impugned legislation has proved to be totally counterproductive and cannot be sustained.""This is the first time that bar dancers themselves have come forward to oppose the Maharashtra law.Till now the challenge was only from hotel, restaurant and dance bar owners. The fresh plea has termed the new Act as ""arbitrary"" and ""violative"" of their right to earn a livelihood through legitimate means. The union alleges that the term ""obscene dance"" in the Act has been deliberately kept vague to allow police to harass performers.The SC had earlier slammed the Maharashtra Police on the matter.

The Python-5 is currently the most capable air-to-air missile (AAM) in Israel's inventory, while the Derby is an active radar homing AAM that provides the SPYDER missile system with a fireand-forget option.""The IAF will use the SPYDER along with the made-in-India Akash surface-to-air missile which has a little longer effective range of 25 km as part of a layered approach to defend vital assets and locations in the country,"" the sources stated.DEAL MADE IN 2008The SPYDER deal was completed by the IAF with Rafael and Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) in 2008 and supplies were to begin in three to four years. But the process got delayed due to the unavailability of the Tatra trucks, which got mired in a controversy over bribery allegations.""Due to the lack of heavy specialised trucks, changes had to be made in the contract with the vendors and a made-in-India truck has been used for carrying the SPYDER system, which has been tested extensively resulting in delays,"" the sources said.Both the SPYDER and Akash are all-weather missiles and the process to seek and engage an aggressive aircraft or missile is automatic. Besides aircraft and UAVs, they can also neutralise lowlevel cruise missiles.The IAF has taken a slew of measures to strengthen its air defence capabilities in the recent past as it is also going to deploy another air defence system called the Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) system from Israel, which can strike down targets at 50-70km.The force would receive a major boost when it starts getting the S-400 air defence missile system from Russia, which can take out targets at 400 km and can be very effective against enemy AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) and cruise missiles at great distances.ALSO READ:  "

4455,"The President of Poland's Supreme Court Malgorzata Gersdorf has urged the country's judges to ""fight every inch"" for justice as the ruling party plans to ""democratise"" the way judges are appointed. Under the government's proposals, the terms of all judges will be terminated within 90 days of the draft law's enactment and their replacements would be selected by Polish parliament.","The president of Poland?s supreme court has urged the country?s judges to ?fight for every inch of justice? as the rightwing government pushes for changes that critics say would make judicial independence a ?pure fiction?.?For over a year I have been repeating that the courts are easily turned into a plaything in the hands of politicians,? Ma?gorzata Gersdorf told her colleagues in an open letter read out at a recent gathering of judges in Warsaw. ?What was until now a threat is becoming a reality.?In its latest battle with Poland?s legal system, the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) says it wants to ?democratise? the way Polish judges are appointed, which at the moment is a job for the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), an autonomous body whose judicial members are chosen by their peers.Under the government?s proposals, however, the terms of all the judicial members of the council would be terminated within 90 days of the draft law?s enactment. Their replacements would be selected by the Polish parliament, with the speaker of the parliament given discretion as to which candidates should be put forward for consideration.Whereas the council?s judicial members presently enjoy a majority, under the government?s proposals the body would be split into two chambers, one for judicial members and the other for political representatives. Both chambers would have to agree to an appointment or a resolution, giving the political representatives a veto over decisions made by the judicial members.?The government?s proposals will be an instrument for ensuring the appointment of the ?right? kind of judges who will not be too critical of the authorities and their political programme,? said Ewa ??towska, a professor at Poland?s Institute of Legal Sciences and a former judge who served on the country?s constitutional tribunal and the supreme administrative court.The council was given less than three working days to respond to the draft act, receiving it from the Ministry of Justice on a Thursday and expected to provide its official response by the following Tuesday. In a strongly worded statement, it described the proposals as ?in obvious and gross contradiction with the Polish constitution?.?The council is an independent constitutional organ that was instituted in 1989 in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, because in the communist era everything was dependent on the ruling party,? Dariusz Zawistowski, chairman of the KRS and a serving supreme court judge, told the Guardian.?When members of the council are elected by the parliament, this function of safeguarding the constitution will be pure fiction. Formally speaking, there would be no independent judiciary.?Gersdorf has urged her fellow judges to risk their own positions in the fight against the proposals.?There is no fight without victims, and among them may be counted some of us present here,? said Gersdorf?s letter to her fellow judges. ?To win, you must be prepared even for disciplinary tribunals, to be removed from office, for anything. You must show that we are in opposition to the pushing of a democratic state into oblivion.?The government describes the proposals as ?enhancing democracy and independence? by freeing the appointments process from ?the corporate interests of the judicial environment?, citing the judicial appointments process in countries such as Spain and Germany.?Objectivity in selecting members of the National Council of the Judiciary and their independence from corporate interests is to be ensured by them being selected by the Sejm, which holds a mandate gained in democratic elections. A similar system is successful for instance in Spain,? said the Ministry of Justice in a statement.But the KRS?s response rejects such comparisons. ?It must be recalled that in accordance with article 8(1) of the constitution, it is the constitution of the Republic of Poland of 2 April 1997 that is the supreme law in the Republic of Poland, and not the constitution of Spain of 31 October 1978 or the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany of 23 May 1949.?The controversy is the latest front in a protracted battle between the PiS and an increasingly demoralised judiciary.Shortly after assuming power in late 2015, the government merged the office of prosecutor general with that of the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, a move that some analysts argue has already allowed the government to exert political pressure on judges.?We have already seen numerous examples of prosecutors answerable to the minister of justice initiating criminal proceedings against judges who have reached decisions they don?t agree with,? said ??towska."
4456,"Japanese electronics maker Sony has unveiled the 'Xperia XZ Premium', the world's first smartphone with 4K HDR display at ?46,700. The phone's 19-megapixel camera has a memory-stacked sensor, making it world's first smartphone camera that records slow motion video at 960 frames per second. The device runs on Android Nougat and has 4 GB RAM and 64 GB inbuilt storage.","Hot on the heels of Nokia, LG and Huawei's, Sony has unveiled their latest Xperia flagship Smartphone - the Xperia XZ Premium at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone. Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away. Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. Also Read:  Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor. Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today. Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing. The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds. The XZ Premium will be the first smartphone to feature the same and offer not only high speeds but much better speeds everywhere. "

The ABVP has been accused of physically assaulting students and teachers, regardless of gender, and Delhi Police has been accused of inaction.Gurmehar's campaign enraged right-wing loyalists, and as seen often on social media, many such people (with untraceable identities, thanks to the power of social media) even made rape threats to her for opposing ABVP.Watch: ABVP enjoys government and institutional patronage, says Umar KhalidVIRENDER SEHWAG'S ENTRYKnown for his witty tweets post his retirement from cricket, Virender Sehwag tweeted a photo of himself holding a placard carrying a (Photoshopped) message saying, ""I didn't score two triple centuries, my bat did"" and saying ""Bat me hai Dum!"" along with #BharatJaisiJagahNahi. Bat me hai Dum !#BharatJaisiJagahNahipic.twitter.com/BNaO1LBHLHThis was in response to learning that Gurmehar Kaur has been part of social media campaigns before as well. She was seen in one such campaign, to ensure better relationship with Pakistan, started by activist Ram Subramanian. Kaur was seen holding a placard that said, ""Pakistan did not kill my dad. War killed him.""#FYI: Twitter is out with memes and jokes on Kargil martyr's daughter for opposing ABVPSehwag's tweet didn't go down well with the sect of people known as ""libtards and sickulars"" but pleased the already enraged right-wing supporters. One fellow liked Sehwag's tweet so much that he said it is even better than Sehwag's triple century achievement. ?प ?ा यह  ?व ? ? त ?  ? ?रिपल स ? ? ? ?र ? स ? भ ?

He quoted the tweet and lauded Sehwag for his wit. Hooda's tweet got 3,300 retweets and fueled more anger towards Gurmehar. When senior journalists called him out for cheering Sehwag, Hooda said Kaur ""is being used as a political pawn and a prop to spread hatred"". This is what followed:So when a girl speaks she is being ""used""? How patronising (&sexist)to assume @mehartweets doesn't have a mind of her own. But that you do? https://t.co/1NggrZOhz4none of these two ""celebs"" will match up to the dignity of this woman.

There have been reports that the Bharatiya Janata Party pays to maintain an army of ""trolls"" that Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha. O'Brien had accused Twitter user Rahul Raj, who goes by the handle @bhak_sala, of making ""rape and communal threats"" on the platform.#FYI: Bhak sala: Rahul Raj, Twitter user Derek O'Brien slammed in Parliament, takes a break from social mediaGurmehar's viral Facebook post said, ""The brutal attack on innocent students by ABVP is very disturbing and should be stopped. It was not an attack on protesters, but an attack on every notion of democracy that is held dear in every Indians heart. It is an attack on ideals, morals, freedom and rights of every person born to this nation."" Standing up against supporters of the ruling party comes with a cost is possibly what many people think. Talking to NDTV, Kaur said, ""I have been getting a lot of threats on social media. I think it is very scary when people threaten you with violence or with rape.""At such a time, when a fellow Indian citizen, a woman, is being threatened with violence and rape on social media, Sehwag's tweet -- even if it was meant to be a joke -- and Hooda's encouragement, is being considered as bullying. ENTER KIREN RIJIJUQuoting Randeep Hooda's tweet cheering Sehwag, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju asked, ""Who's polluting this young girl's mind? A strong Arm Force prevents a war. India never attacked anyone but a weak India was always invaded,"" in response to the ""Pakistan did not kill my dad"" message Kaur tried to spread last May. Who's polluting this young girl's mind? A strong Arm Force prevents a war. India never attacked anyone but a weak India was always invaded. https://t.co/gXHkAGi9shMany Twitter users are now wondering why Kaur, an adult, cannot have thought processes and opinions of her own and why a Union Minister would say that ""her mind has been polluted"".Talking to the press, Rijiju also said people living in India should not talk against the nation.

4468,"The adoption of GST could help raise India's medium-term GDP growth to over 8% and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, IMF has said. Further, IMF said that the implementation of a robust GST regime should be a key priority for the country, given its growth-enhancing effects.","From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 22 (PTI) The adoption of the GST could help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to over eight per cent and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, the IMF said today. At the same time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also expressed concerns over the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST). ""Although some uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the GST, its adoption is poised to help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to above 8 per cent as it will create a single national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services,"" the IMF said in its annual country report on India. The IMF said larger than expected gains from the GST and further structural reforms could lead to significantly stronger growth, while a sustained period of continued low global energy prices would also be beneficial to India. Noting that Indias tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (at around 17 and a half per cent) remains considerably below than its emerging market peers, the IMF said the implementation of a robust GST should be a key priority given its growth-enhancing effects. ""The GST should have minimal exemptions, uniform cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible,"" it said. Key production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors, the IMF said. Rationalisation of the structure of direct taxes toward a lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should continue, it said. Efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. According to the IMF report, Indian authorities were confident that the outstanding issues related to GST implementation could be settled promptly. ""The GST would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. Tax reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax deductions,"" it said. The GST replaces a plethora of cascading center, state, interstate and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services. "

""Youve heard about so-called helicopter drops of money with unconventional monetary policies, so one way to characterise this demonetisation initiative is as a vacuum cleaner,"" Paul A Cashin, Assistant Director in the IMFs Asia and Pacific Department, and mission chief of India, told PTI. ""Its sucking in cash, withdrawing it from the economy, and then the vacuum cleaner is going in reverse, slowly replacing cash but as I said, at a fairly modest pace. Thats led to a lot of cash shortages that have adversely affected consumption,"" Cashin said in response to a question as the IMF released its annual country-report on India. Given the shortage of cash in the market, IMF in its report urged the Indian Government to continue to enhance the supply of new banknotes, and if needed consider extending or expanding targeted temporary exemptions, including on use of old banknotes, particularly for rural and remote areas. ""While the financial system is expected to weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth slowdown, the authorities should remain vigilant given the potential further build-up of NPAs and elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities, and ensure prudent support to the economic sectors affected by the currency exchange initiative,"" the IMF said. IMF said the repercussions from Indias currency exchange initiative will likely persist through the first quarter of 2017. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 6.6 per cent in FY2016/17 and then rebound to 7.2 per cent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions (primarily to private consumption) caused by cash shortages accompanying the currency exchange initiative.

I won't lie. This all will also go to the xxxx,"" he claimed.If he was to be believed, crooks are procuring prosthetic fingers to trick poll officials into allowing them in election booths for multiple voting, possibly in multiple booths.Prosthetic consultants at P&O International Inc operating from Delhi's Vimhans hospital quoted a price of Rs 1.10 lakh for 10 silicone fingers.

It has been rated 2/5 (HT) and 3.5/5 (TOI, India Today).","Rangoon is a triangular love story set in the backdrop of World War II. Here is our Rangoon movie review.Rangoon Cast: Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali KhanRangoon Direction: Vishal BhardwajRangoon Rating:  (3.5/5)When Rusi Bilmoria (Saif Ali Khan), an ex-film star who has been just a producer since an on-set accident, finds out that his fiance, the love of his life Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut), also the top star of his company, has cheated on him with a soldier, Jamadar Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), he turns his head silently towards his woman and looks at her with eyes red with grief, shock and the rage of a thousand suns.If you thought Saif Ali Khan's best moment in the movies till date was the scene in Omkara where he, Langda Tyagi, looks and keeps looking at Ajay Devgn in disbelief when Omkara (Ajay Devgn) makes Kesu (Vivek Oberoi) his political successor; well, stop right there. Saif has outdone his Omkara moment with the aforementioned scene from Rangoon. That alone is worth the price of the ticket.That and the beautiful, almost feral chemistry between the loyal soldier of the British Indian Army, Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), and '40s queen of the Indian big screen Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut).ALSO SEE: Before Rangoon's Julia, meet the original 'Hunterwali'Rangoon is a triangular love story between Nawab, Julia and Rusi. The story begins in 1943 in India when the British Army requests Rusi Bilmoria to send his beloved, Miss Julia, to the Indo-Burma border so that she can entertain the nation's soldiers. Rusi, a nation-lover, does his duty and sends off Julia with his troupe plus Nawab Malik as Julia's personal security. When the Japanese bomb them on their way, Malik and Julia manage to escape into Burma and, well, love blooms.Vishal Bhardwaj's most expensive and, of late, his most accessible film Rangoon sails smoothly as long its hero and heroine are allowed to just be. Malik and Julia's romance is slow-cooked and the essence of every moment between the two is allowed to linger before the next moment starts. It feels like Nawab Malik and Julia are floating in their own dreamland, perfectly content with the scheme of things, and consequently, Rangoon appears to feel content with itself, devoid of any duties to formal narrative storytelling. There is no rush to fast-forward to the next plot device in this entire stretch where Malik and Julia's romance is built up.Watch Yeh Ishq Hai from Rangoon here:Therefore, in the second half, when Vishal Bhardwaj and Co. pull up their socks to tie all the loose ends and ensure that all three protagonists - Malik, Julia and Rusi - find poetic justice, regardless of how laborious that pursuit might look on screen, Rangoon slowly, slowly bends and breaks its back under the pressure of Vishal Bhardwaj's narrative ambitions.ALSO SEE: Will Rangoon prove to be another Queen for Kangana Ranaut?Rangoon is gorgeous-looking with great cinematography (Pankaj Kumar, take a bow), fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography (Farah Khan, Sudesh Adhana). Love-making in the mud has never looked (and probably, never will) this sexy in a mainstream Hindi film. All that is fine. Where Rangoon does a bloody fail is its attempt to see through its two parallel narrative strands finding a common end: one, the love story, and the other, the war-conspiracy backdrop with the British Indian Army and Subhas Chandra Bose's INA mixed up.Vishal Bhardwaj, caught with the duty to serve two movies in one (an old-school romance and a war thriller), doesn't really do a Casablanca though he does give Rangoon his best shot. Nevertheless, Rangoon comes off as probably 2017's most good-looking and well-made Indian film. Certainly, this year's most ambitious, with three great lead performances. Vishal Bhardwaj is in fine form, mostly. And yes, the National Anthem comes thrice in the film.

That we look differently at our daughters. And probably we aren?t able to give the same treatment to our daughters as our sons.
